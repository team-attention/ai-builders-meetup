00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,519
Hello, I'm Kim Seojin, and I'll be presenting on the topic of operating an AI-Native Company.

2
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:19,320
First off, we discuss a lot about what an AI-Native company is,

3
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:36,219
and I've defined AI-Native not as people using AI through systems and tools, but rather as AI Agents using systems and tools themselves.

4
00:00:36,219 --> 00:00:41,320
So what should an AI-Native Company look like?

5
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:49,299
Instead of people like Backend engineers, Frontend engineers, and DevOps using AI for development,

6
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:56,019
there's an Orchestrator, and AI that plays backend roles and AI that plays frontend roles.

7
00:00:56,019 --> 00:01:05,280
Various AI agents with different roles perform defined workflows and access resources through systems and tools.

8
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,439
This is ultimately what I've defined as an AI-Native Company.

9
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:18,799
So I left my job as an engineer who was doing AI-Assisted development,

10
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:25,840
and built an AI-Native Company from scratch.

11
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:34,439
So I've set up an Orchestrator to execute 22 Agents and 50 Workflows.

12
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:40,719
Looking at how this system works, the user makes a request,

13
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:45,819
and I customized the Agent Council created by Team Attention,

14
00:01:45,819 --> 00:01:48,780
with various types of LLMs and

15
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,519
Agent Councils with different roles that make decisions on

16
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:57,260
ambiguous or unclear matters in between,

17
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:04,219
and through those, the Orchestrator executes Agents and Skills.

18
00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:09,020
This AI-Native Company has two teams.

19
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:15,780
First, there's AI-Native Builders, and a team called AI-Native Marketers.

20
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,780
And just for reference, this company ultimately helps with marketing agency work for various beauty brands,

21
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:38,780
and I'm running it alone by building two AI teams: the AI-Native Builders development team and AI-Native Marketers.

22
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:44,780
Let me introduce how I built this AI-Native Builders.

23
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:52,780
When a user inputs something, I proactively define how to orchestrate it,

24
00:02:52,780 --> 00:03:07,780
and at the planning layer, depending on the specific information in my request, I decide whether to bring in context or external information through research,

25
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:13,780
and the solution planner decides which tech stack to use for development.

26
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:17,780
In the builder layer, there are actually two types:

27
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:30,780
when implementing features in existing services, it retrieves the architecture and context from the existing service and implements features following them,

28
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:40,780
and in the case of service builders, various agents are selected according to the specified tech stack to proceed with development.

29
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:46,780
So as I mentioned earlier, for technical decisions or architecture reviews,

30
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:49,780
decisions are made by the technical council.

31
00:03:49,780 --> 00:04:01,780
That way, even with simple requests, I made it so the Builders can operate according to my existing development workflow.

32
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:11,780
For example, if I specify to create a certain service and what the tech stack should be,

33
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:20,779
an Agent called Research Confirmist retrieves all the information from external resources.

34
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:28,779
It gathers background information like what this blog service should be like and what features should be included,

35
00:04:28,779 --> 00:04:34,779
and then through the planner, it decides how to design the architecture and structure,

36
00:04:34,779 --> 00:04:44,779
and the UI designer calls a Skill called brand design system that I created beforehand to make design decisions.

37
00:04:44,779 --> 00:04:52,779
From implementation to deployment, it actually takes about 90 minutes.

38
00:04:52,779 --> 00:04:57,779
There are actually a lot of outputs, but I've selected some of them.

39
00:04:57,779 --> 00:05:13,779
For example, a site where you can see CS146, which went very viral recently, translated into Korean with slides, GitHub, PDF, and website all available, or creating variations of advertising materials tailored to the company's brand and products.

40
00:05:14,779 --> 00:05:22,779
Generating content, or identifying and analyzing trending signals on TikTok,

41
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:31,779
and understanding the semantics of TikTok comments - we're delivering these services to clients.

42
00:05:31,779 --> 00:05:39,779
I want to share four key points I've learned about what works well,

43
00:05:39,779 --> 00:05:50,779
and first, it works much better when you structure the work processes that exist as tacit knowledge in your head and define them in Skills.

44
00:05:50,779 --> 00:06:01,779
For example, even when researching and gathering information, people have internal criteria for judging the reliability of that information,

45
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:10,779
so official documentation is P0, tech blogs are P1, and something like Naver JisikIn would be P3 or P4.

46
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:13,779
First structure how you work like this,

47
00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:19,779
and it works much better when you make Skills or Agents reproduce them.

48
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:24,779
I'm sure you're familiar with Spec-Driven Development,

49
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:34,779
and then at each plan stage, I design in advance with gates when to proceed to the next page and when not to.

50
00:06:34,779 --> 00:06:38,779
So I create criteria for those gates in advance,

51
00:06:38,779 --> 00:06:44,779
for example, if test coverage is 70% or higher here, proceed, otherwise make it go through the iteration again,

52
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:54,779
it's important to set merge conditions for gates well at various points.

53
00:06:54,779 --> 00:07:05,779
Lastly, things like understanding Django can be solved by AI fetching documents well.

54
00:07:05,779 --> 00:07:13,779
So as I'm building this system, I'm thinking more about how AI can use frameworks well rather than understanding the frameworks themselves.

55
00:07:34,779 --> 00:07:45,779
creating materials, and after creating materials, the AI Reviewer decides what needs to be revised,

56
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:50,779
what doesn't match our brand guidelines, or gives scores and such.

57
00:07:50,779 --> 00:07:56,779
After actually running performance marketing, it retrieves those metrics,

58
00:07:56,779 --> 00:08:05,779
and the marketer directly reviews why the creatives that worked well worked and why those that didn't work didn't work, and these criteria continuously accumulate in the AI system.

59
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:13,779
And then after a certain point, the AI automatically looks at the results,

60
00:08:13,779 --> 00:08:19,779
creates variations on its own, and executes marketing.

61
00:08:19,779 --> 00:08:26,779
So actually extracting layouts and brand assets from external sources, creating variations from there,

62
00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:29,779
generating marketing at once, the marketing performance workflow,

63
00:08:29,779 --> 00:08:34,779
why it worked well when actually executed, what worked well, what didn't work,

64
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:40,779
and even deciding how much marketing budget to allocate going forward - the AI Agent makes these decisions

65
00:08:40,779 --> 00:08:44,779
and has reached the stage where it can actually execute them.

66
00:08:50,779 --> 00:08:55,779
So over the past 40 days, the AI-Native Company

67
00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:14,459
was able to create and deliver about 30 services using about 4.46 billion tokens.

68
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:18,480
Through this maximization of productivity,

69
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,759
I'm building an automated brand system that can be operated by one person.

70
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:30,899
I wanted to discuss whether your team is fully leveraging the potential of AI,

71
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:37,839
and whether there are areas where you could do better,

72
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:45,620
and I'll reach out to those interested in the future of branding and marketing being transformed by this.

73
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,920
That concludes my presentation.
