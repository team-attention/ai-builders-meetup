00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Yes, I'm a bit nervous. I'm Donghoon Lee, leading the AI Lab team at Myrealtrip.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Let me briefly introduce myself. I was an engineer

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I was an infrastructure engineer. I wrote 10 years, but it wasn't quite 10 years. For the past 7 years, I worked on monitoring

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:44,000
systems, CI/CD, container environments, and various tasks like DevOps, DBA, SRE

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I did all sorts of things. I was basically a jack-of-all-trades.

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:56,000
But as I watched my seniors doing the same work, I really felt

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Why do we keep reinventing the wheel when it already exists in the market?

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
They kept reinventing the wheel and then got crushed by it and quit.

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So I felt very strongly in the company that I shouldn't be like that.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:18,000
There are so many things already available in the market. I just need to assemble them. I decided not to become an inventor.

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I think I started thinking that way back then.

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Then I encountered GPT-3, and I think I was thinking a lot like this at that time.

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It was about 2 years ago.

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Back then, our platform team of about 6 people was serving about 1,000

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
engineers.

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:48,000
That's really tough. Developing software and maintaining systems is already hard, but

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
we had to handle all kinds of requests.

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Even though we built the systems, the questions were so diverse

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:08,000
and those 1,000 developers were very creative in developing and deploying software.

21
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I had to continuously provide guidance for those situations, and even with great documentation

22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
it wasn't easy to find and provide the right information.

23
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So I couldn't work during the day or evening. I could only work at dawn and on weekends

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I was thinking about how to solve this, and when I met GPT-3, it felt like I saw the light.

25
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
That's when RAG existed, so it was a bit like that for me.

26
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And so I built several RAG-based chatbots using various internal data sources

27
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:56,000
and based on that, when leadership decided we needed AI transformation

28
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I was able to lead this organization.

29
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So that's how it happened.

30
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:12,000
We wrote our mission statement like this. Actually, it's not super meaningful.

31
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
But the most important thing is raising AI literacy for all employees.

32
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:26,000
And I don't think we've reached the red text below yet. I think we're mostly focused on raising literacy.

33
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:34,000
So we're doing these things to raise literacy, though some we're not doing anymore.

34
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Mainly, we hold internal case-sharing sessions every week.

35
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'll explain later, but we do weekly presentations in "Everyone AI" sessions.

36
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:54,000
To make that happen, we go hunting for cases every week. When someone uses it well, we share and give awards

37
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:02,000
When there's a team like that, I immediately go interview them, have them present, and give them money. So far

38
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
we've had over 40 presentations.

39
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Some presentations introduced more than two cases.

40
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So the number is a bit more than that.

41
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And we briefly ran a program called Myrealtrip Kmong.

42
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Similar to what we're doing now, like today's presentation topic, we connected people who define problems with people who solve them

43
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It was like a matchmaking platform. We launched five projects

44
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
And lastly, what we're doing now is the AI Champion Training Program.

45
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I felt many limitations in connecting core and delta, so now

46
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
you solve your own problems.

47
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And we provide a different level of support than before.

48
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'll explain this more later.

49
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So how we've been working and what lessons we learned

50
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
We've had many failures too.

51
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
So I'll explain that through about 4 scenes.

52
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I've been on this team for 1 year and 1 month now.

53
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Last November, I started working concurrently on the SRE team and AI Lab.

54
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So I just thought I'd do what I always did - build software and deliver it.

55
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm a developer, so naturally I learned LangChain and LangGraph, so let me find problems I can solve with this.

56
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I approached it quite clumsily.

57
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Looking back now.

58
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
But there were about 5 business divisions at the time.

59
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:02,000
So I met with each division head to listen to their inconveniences and unsolved problems

60
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And then we launched three things: a chatbot platform, a keyword extraction engine for SEO, and review translation

61
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000
A review translation system. We launched these 3 and ran them for about 2 months.

62
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And then we just threw away all the projects.

63
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Threw them in the trash. Actually, even before those 2 months ended, I had a bad feeling

64
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
about it.

65
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:38,000
For example, with SEO, the marketing team responsible for traffic should obviously have ownership

66
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
but the marketing team didn't come to me.

67
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'm not sure why that was.

68
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
So I was working on things that weren't important.

69
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
From a business perspective.

70
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:00,000
What I want to talk about here is that the counterpart I was working with

71
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:08,000
would meet with me weekly for sync-ups like homework, getting assignments, but it didn't seem important to them and they didn't know

72
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,000
what the return would be, so even I could feel it wasn't going well.

73
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:22,000
So I thought I needed to report the situation quickly somehow

74
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I wrote very detailed wikis every week about goals and current situation, and kept reporting to my PO and CEO.

75
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:38,000
After doing that for about two months, I think they also realized that this wasn't working.

76
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:46,000
So we decided to set up the roadmap again, and in a way, I could be delta

77
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
but I couldn't be echo.

78
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm not someone with great business sense or a strategist.

79
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I might be good at implementation. That's what I felt.

80
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:06,000
So let's start from scratch again. Literacy came up again at that time

81
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
and we decided to pivot to education.

82
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It was really confusing.

83
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I was a coder, and I didn't think I knew enough to teach anyone.

84
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
This was around February this year.

85
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,000
There was a lot of interest in developing and tuning models.

86
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I don't have a machine learning background, so what can I teach?

87
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
What can I show people?

88
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I was in that kind of vague state.

89
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,000
But anyway, I couldn't not start.

90
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,000
So I decided to just start, and I started with how to use ChatGPT.

91
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:00,000
What I said during that ChatGPT usage session is so embarrassing now

92
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:08,000
When evaluating team members, export all Jira tickets and give them to ChatGPT 3.5

93
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
and have it summarize what this person did. That level.

94
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And small tips like how to write formulas in Google Sheets. I started with those little things.

95
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I shared things like that. And at that time, I was

96
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,000
deeply interested in developing RAG systems based on AI.

97
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Anyway, I was continuously learning about building agent systems, so I thought

98
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I should teach some of this too, and I looked for people who could teach it.

99
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I even contacted a YouTuber and got quotes, but I couldn't convince management

100
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
to go that far.

101
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:08,000
In the end, it was really good that case studies had much more power than knowing how-to.

102
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Telling my story is good, and when colleagues around me are facing similar problems

103
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:24,000
and solving them, people gain confidence and think "I can do this too"

104
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
and take on challenges.

105
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Seeing that, I was surprised too, and I felt that this was much more effective

106
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,000
than taking lectures.

107
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:48,000
That's right. So even though I initially planted a weak idea

108
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:56,000
some people tried first. As I saw these attempts succeed, from that point

109
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:04,000
other people started asking me questions, but not just "I asked ChatGPT and it didn't work"

110
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:12,000
They succeeded at the first step of "I think I can do something"

111
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
and failed at the second step.

112
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:26,000
So when I showed them methods and they solved it, it gave me much more sense of efficacy

113
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I think.

114
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:38,000
After that, this happened. As cases kept being created and shared, at that time

115
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:46,000
what we were mainly doing was developing Chrome extensions or automating operations in Google Apps Script

116
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,000
with Google Sheets or Google Docs.

117
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
As you know, there's not that much you can do.

118
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
In that situation, people wanted to go further.

119
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:08,000
They wanted to automate the entire workflow, but when they asked ChatGPT, it said "Learn Python, learn TypeScript"

120
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
"Run Node.js" - people were getting guidance like that.

121
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,000
But these non-developers came to me asking "How do I do Python?"

122
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
"My head is going to explode."

123
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
"What should I do? Please teach me."

124
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,000
These kinds of inquiries started coming in, and I wondered, is it right to make these people do this?

125
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
What should I do?

126
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Just saying "you can do it" didn't seem like enough. I thought about that a lot.

127
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:44,000
So I thought, let's connect them with developers, and that's how

128
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Myrealtrip Kmong started.

129
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Actually, with Myrealtrip Kmong at first, I approached this work thinking I needed to build a software system

130
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:02,000
and I said I'd do it in a month, but then I wasted a month.

131
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
That's what happened.

132
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I'll explain the lesson a bit more later.

133
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
But Myrealtrip Kmong launched 5 projects and then we just closed it.

134
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Actually, even running Myrealtrip Kmong was really difficult.

135
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Because we had to connect business experts with development experts, but developers don't understand the business

136
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:36,000
so they obviously can't solve their problems. To raise their understanding to that level required a lot of interviews and analysis.

137
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And this was basically a bidding competition program, so when 2 or more people applied, we had to select one

138
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
That's how the program was structured.

139
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,000
So an unspecified number of people had to understand the business.

140
00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:00,000
So I spent almost a week just interviewing and taking screenshots.

141
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:08,000
That was difficult, but the real problem was after all the software was delivered.

142
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Maintenance was the issue.

143
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,000
These people paid a service fee and received delivered software.

144
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,000
In that state, when maintenance issues arose, they couldn't solve them.

145
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
They don't know Python, so how can they fix a Python program they received?

146
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
That situation happened.

147
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:38,000
And quite emptily, the developers kept solving those maintenance issues.

148
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
But they had no motivation at all.

149
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,000
They briefly worked on things that didn't align with their goals at all.

150
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Actually, the reason they could do it was the prize money.

151
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:58,000
It was all about the prize money, and once the one-time prize was paid, the problem solvers

152
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
didn't really need to maintain it actively.

153
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
That's how it was.

154
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:12,000
And as I said, since it wasn't their business or goal, no matter how hard they worked on it

155
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
it wouldn't reflect in their performance.

156
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
So I felt again at that time.

157
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
People must solve their own problems.

158
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:28,000
But thankfully at that time

159
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
we have a finance and accounting team.

160
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:40,000
The team leader, who had never done software development or engineering

161
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:48,000
built a Qt-based desktop standalone application in Python to automate their work

162
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,000
automating Excel manual work.

163
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Beyond doing it themselves, they assigned team members "do this, do that" and made them present weekly.

164
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I didn't know, actually.

165
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
That person is now a member of our team.

166
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Seeing that gave me courage too.

167
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,000
With Cursor's features improving, it became possible.

168
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
The world was changing so much.

169
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:24,000
So from then on, non-developers can do everything.

170
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:32,000
They can make web services, Chrome extensions, standalone applications - they can make everything

171
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I gained that confidence then and closed Myrealtrip Kmong.

172
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:44,000
So the program we started again

173
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
is the AI Champion Training Program.

174
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,000
As we wrote, the core principle is solving your own problems.

175
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
And this program was initially run very ad-hoc.

176
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
People would say "I want to do this" and come join, things like that.

177
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:08,000
As we gradually established a framework, I thought about what program we could benchmark

178
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
and thought Y Combinator's batch program was somewhat similar.

179
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Except for investment, their mentoring program seems similar to ours.

180
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
We run it in batches.

181
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:28,000
So how we work now is - I couldn't really put photos here but

182
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:36,000
we open office hours for 2 hours a day, and people working on projects can come anytime within those 2 hours.

183
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Our team member acts as a tutor and is present, and we sync up with each person who comes about their current situation

184
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:52,000
what problems they're facing, and we just try to solve it together for about 30 minutes.

185
00:17:52,000 --> 00:18:00,000
If they gain knowledge or if I can prove that something is possible, they take it back

186
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
and try it themselves.

187
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:10,000
We're doing a lot of these things, and among the completed projects

188
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:18,000
let me introduce a few. A designer made a Figma plugin to create advertising materials

189
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:26,000
It was originally an animation but you can't see it now, but when you run the plugin

190
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
a modal window pops up like that.

191
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:36,000
If you input some parameters there, since we're a travel company, for travel promotion materials

192
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:44,000
it renders each card that goes on the promotion page. So when you input a product ID

193
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:50,000
it extracts the properties, how should I put it.

194
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
For example, if it's a hotel.

195
00:18:52,000 --> 00:19:00,000
It randomly picks a few hotel room photos or pool photos and fills them as card content, and for the hotel's

196
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:08,000
detailed information text, it sends a call to the Anthropic API and

197
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:16,000
generates hooking phrases, and fills different card types - horizontal, vertical, square

198
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:22,000
with these templates to generate them instantly. That's the plugin they made.

199
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
The second one is also advertising.

200
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:38,000
They made a back office web application for their business like that, and

201
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:46,000
made the company's official homepage, and a marketer made an airline price comparison site

202
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:54,000
to increase traffic to our flights - they did experiments like that too.

203
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
The lessons learned here are about four.

204
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:06,000
First, in our case-sharing sessions, seeing colleagues next to you succeed and gaining confidence is most important.

205
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Rather than what power tools you can use or how to use them, just having confidence that you can do it is much more

206
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
important.

207
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Second, it's best when someone with ownership does this work.

208
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:30,000
In Myrealtrip Kmong, when someone without ownership solved problems, communication costs were very high and it wasn't

209
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
easy to sustain.

210
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Third, we always run with a small team. I started as a team of one, and now

211
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
we're 3 people. For a while it was 2 people.

212
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:52,000
So we're also making a lot of efforts to work AI-natively, and as you can see here, when champions

213
00:20:52,000 --> 00:21:00,000
apply for a batch, we created pre-interviews to get more

214
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
specific answers we want.

215
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:10,000
And finally, start quickly and visualize.

216
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:18,000
This is two things. Actually, for the Myrealtrip Kmong project, I wasted a month trying to build a system, but after meeting with my leader

217
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
we made the first case in 15 minutes and launched immediately.

218
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Ignoring all the system.

219
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Actually, I witnessed my developer clumsiness again

220
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
at that moment.

221
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:40,000
And second, this is about raising literacy, how can we effectively

222
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
gain motivation and do this?

223
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
What you see here isn't about using coding tools.

224
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
It's just calculating how many lines you wrote and creating a ranking.

225
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Like this, we collect all events and work done internally as metrics as much as possible

226
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:08,000
and enable competition.

227
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:16,000
And now we're thinking about various things. Initially, I thought we shouldn't develop

228
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:24,000
but these days, development costs are converging to almost zero, so now it seems worth challenging again

229
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:32,000
And in a way, the systems we want to build are becoming more sophisticated

230
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:40,000
and requirements are getting acutely difficult, so I think it would be good to build something. So we're developing agents

231
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:48,000
And I've been mainly working with non-developers, but the development organization also needs to think about

232
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:56,000
the next stage much more, and we're continuing to research what the 10x engineer that everyone talks about

233
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
looks like and how to define it.

234
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Thank you.
