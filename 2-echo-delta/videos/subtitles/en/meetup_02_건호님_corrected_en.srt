00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, I'm Gunho Shin from DAY1COMPANY.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Today's topic is "Highly Advanced AX is Indistinguishable from Entrepreneurship."

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I made the slides quite wordy, but since the presentation materials will be shared afterwards,

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I wrote detailed content so you can understand by reading it.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Let me proceed quickly.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
There are three things today.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
First, I'll share what I learned while missing AX opportunities,

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and ultimately explain that highly advanced AX is indistinguishable from entrepreneurship.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:45,000
From that perspective, I prepared this presentation to share the AX playbook rules I came up with.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'll talk more about the third point later,

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
but since this is Echo & Delta, I'm here to claim I'm an AX consultant.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So I brought my career path briefly.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The characteristic of a consultant is always having a broad and shallow skillset.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Currently, I'm the head of DAY1COMPANY's B2B business division,

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
and I'm working with the assignment to generate revenue or operating profit.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So I'm doing BD.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
What's actually scary is what I felt while doing BD for a year.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I worked logically. So what?

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I solved problems. So what?

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Did you generate revenue and operating profit? Having to answer that is really scary.

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
If that doesn't come out, 100 people's salaries depend on me,

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
so 2025 was a year of tremendous pressure.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Before that, I was a PO at doeat and did consulting for over 2 years.

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Then I did Python-based modeling in the financial sector and wrote some code,

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
and then at KAIST I engaged with machine learning and deep learning,

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
and have a background of installing that mindset as an engineer.

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So now in the company, I'm a division head, so my role is to bring in money.

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Interestingly though, it is an environment where I can immerse myself in the topic of AX.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So because we provide AX education comprehensively to enterprise-level customers,

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I end up hearing a lot about what AX needs exist at the large enterprise level.

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
After all, providing AX education means they want to do AX.

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I naturally heard those needs, but of course they're vague.

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
The education they want is also vague.

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,000
By meeting early adopter-type customers and diagnosing and structuring those needs,

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I tell them "you need this kind of education,"

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
and it feels like we can just do a new business combining consulting and build services.

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So I'm trying to launch it next year.

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
If internal customers are on the left, internally for me,

39
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
the goal isn't to achieve AX but to make money.

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
But ultimately, the best number one way to increase productivity in this era is AX,

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
so I did all sorts of things to increase productivity.

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Internal education alone doesn't increase productivity just by doing it,

43
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
so I thought I should make it myself.

44
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So I made and deployed projects,

45
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
like Gems, GPTs projects, dashboards, agents that create agents, Gems, GPTs, etc.

46
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I tried hard to deploy them.

47
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
In November this year, I officially set up an AI Transformation team.

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Naturally, as Donghoon mentioned,

49
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
resources aren't sufficient.

50
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Whatever you do, bring in money.

51
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Because of this, I can't starve myself and close my eyes,

52
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
so I just picked the 4 smartest people from the education team,

53
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
reassigned them, and although they didn't know n8n, they started studying.

54
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Now after various trial and error,

55
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
we're completely rebuilding the proposal workflow.

56
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
From when leads are collected to the final proposal that goes to customers,

57
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
we're making it output as PPT.

58
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
And it's working better than expected.

59
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So this is what I'm doing with AX right now.

60
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
My core question is: how can we succeed in AI transformation?

61
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And beyond increasing individual productivity,

62
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
how do we get to the organizational level?

63
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
That's the question I have.

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Probably everyone here today has the same question.

65
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
This is the technology adoption curve.

66
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Where do you think you are among those attending today?

67
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You're probably here, naturally.

68
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
What I felt when doing AX meetings or education meetings with large companies

69
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
and looking at internal business members

70
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
is that for those of you here, it's about here.

71
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You're ridiculously extreme outliers,

72
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
but where is my team leader?

73
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
From a business perspective, if the team leader is here, thank you.

74
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And the marketing team, education team, sales team that need to do AX,

75
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
if they're here, thank you.

76
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
To go beyond individual productivity to organizational productivity,

77
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
you have to force this on these people.

78
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I have to do it.

79
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I have to do all this to these people,

80
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
and usually that's the case.

81
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Why am I getting tangled up with you?

82
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Ultimately, it's a very difficult task.

83
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And C-level people don't easily give resources.

84
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
From that perspective,

85
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
unless you're in a leadership position in this era, the opportunity itself

86
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
to try organizational-level productivity through AX

87
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
is only 2-3 tries even for leaders.

88
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
So what I want to say is,

89
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
because it's this difficult,

90
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
if I share what I learned from successful and failed AX,

91
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
we can reduce that trial and error,

92
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
waste fewer tickets,

93
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
that's what I think.

94
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
What I did first

95
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
was start with thinking

96
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
"I should make a proposal search system" beyond education.

97
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I started from there.

98
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
So we have a workflow where our education consultants hear customer needs

99
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
and propose by introducing education.

100
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
At first, I proceeded by the book.

101
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Naturally, I captured the workflow from interviews.

102
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Then I drew it all out.

103
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
When this exists, I made about 4 agents

104
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
that draw it like this,

105
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
so when this goes in, it comes out like this.

106
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I made it thinking "how impressive."

107
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Naturally, after analyzing the workflow,

108
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
what do they tell you to do next?

109
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
They tell you to analyze bottlenecks.

110
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
So when I looked, ultimately

111
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
in collecting internal materials,

112
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
they were spending too much time.

113
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Depending on the customer's key points,

114
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
the proposals to reference are all different,

115
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
but they're all on Drive, about 300 of them.

116
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You have to open and look at them all,

117
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
so I thought "This is perfect low-hanging fruit for AX."

118
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
So I made it.

119
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
The resources I invested were:

120
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
At that time, there was a strategy team.

121
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Practitioner interviews, the strategy team

122
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
summarized, I planned,

123
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
and the product group leader developed it.

124
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
First deployment, feedback, second deployment, but

125
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
then it failed.

126
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
No one really uses it now.

127
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's just abandoned.

128
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Anyway, there was one

129
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
failed AX case.

130
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
But then

131
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
the second one among various attempts

132
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
that succeeded was

133
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
a service called skill consulting,

134
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
which has a pipeline.

135
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Just doing AX on this service

136
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
was a successful experience.

137
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
To explain simply,

138
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
skill consulting is

139
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
for a battery solution company,

140
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
a company that does electric vehicle batteries,

141
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
in their R&D division,

142
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
80 teams, about 100 job functions,

143
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
defining the software skills

144
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
needed for R&D

145
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
and creating an education system.

146
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It takes 18 weeks or something like that.

147
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
What I want to say is,

148
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
if a big department store like this

149
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
says they'll do skill consulting, you can leave it to the team,

150
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
but since I was a consultant,

151
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I had a gut feeling that if I left it as is,

152
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
there would be trouble.

153
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
At minimum, 4 people would be invested for two weeks,

154
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
and even pulling all-nighters, time would be insufficient.

155
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
At this time, there was no

156
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
workflow analysis.

157
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I just wrote all the logic

158
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
from start to finish, created agents,

159
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
and deployed it with vibe coding

160
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
all the way to creating interview sheets.

161
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Naturally, in that process,

162
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I also worked with GPT

163
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
to create questions

164
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
for establishing logic as a consultant.

165
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
And I developed this directly.

166
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
But

167
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
then

168
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
after creating this difficult consulting

169
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
work, the entire AS pipeline,

170
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I ran about 5 iterations

171
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
by myself.

172
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Creating logic and seeing the output all the way to the end,

173
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
thinking "Oh, the logic is

174
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
too heavy," coming back and going from start

175
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
to end to end. But what was really interesting was

176
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
that when consulting,

177
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
you can't run these iterations. Unlike development.

178
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
People have to do manual labor

179
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
for a long time,

180
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
and you can only see results after 8 weeks.

181
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
But now working with AI,

182
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I ran it 5 times

183
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
and deployed it to the team.

184
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
So I spent 5 hours every Saturday

185
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
alone making this workflow,

186
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
and it's very accurate. 5 GPTs are

187
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
connected, and you put JSON from number 1

188
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
into number 2, and put JSON from number 2

189
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
that GPT analyzed

190
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
into the next result

191
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
consecutively, and when you upload it here,

192
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
it creates interview sheets in Excel.

193
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
In a way, it's

194
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
a much more unfamiliar

195
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
new workflow than the existing

196
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
proposal search system,

197
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
so I wondered

198
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
if the people actually doing this work

199
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
would use it,

200
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
but this was actually a huge success.

201
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Everyone switched. They just use it

202
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
even though they don't know what JSON is.

203
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Just on this webpage,

204
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
a link. When I worked in the business division,

205
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
if I went in with this link

206
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
and said "please use this," they would never use it.

207
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
They're just abandoned links,

208
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
but this one, everyone actually used it so much

209
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
that everyone switched to the new workflow.

210
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
So now

211
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
the decisive difference is just one thing.

212
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
First,

213
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I learned that the magnitude of efficiency determines

214
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
AX success.

215
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Looking at what failed,

216
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
the existing proposal selection time was about 1 to 2 hours,

217
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
and using this would reduce it to about 15 minutes.

218
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
About a 4x change.

219
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
This AX case,

220
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
if you didn't use it alone,

221
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
if you didn't switch to this workflow and did it the existing way,

222
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
working 12 hours a day

223
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
for 2 weeks,

224
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
it would take 120 hours, but using this

225
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
you can somehow get away with it.

226
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
So everyone used it.

227
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Ultimately, the efficiency I always thought about

228
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
was that 10x or 20x, I will definitely switch.

229
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
4x or 5x is not even close.

230
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
That's what I thought.

231
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
So why did it succeed?

232
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
The pain size was large,

233
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I did it better AI-Native,

234
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
and at that time

235
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
communication costs were high,

236
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
but this worked well because I did it alone?

237
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Also, interestingly,

238
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
looking at domain size,

239
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I used proposals much more, and skill consulting

240
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
was less,

241
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
and at this time, looking at the tech stack, I used it

242
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
more heavily. At that time, I only used GPTs.

243
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Leadership drive

244
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
was both driven by me,

245
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
so these individual

246
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
components written down,

247
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
this whole thing lacks

248
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
explanatory power to explain why success and failure,

249
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
and it feels unsettling.

250
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
What really

251
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
flashed through my mind

252
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
was that ultimately it's no different from entrepreneurship.

253
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I reached that thought.

254
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
So

255
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
first, the key is

256
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
if you think carefully about the first commonality

257
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
between AX and software startups,

258
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
ultimately you succeed only when you make customers

259
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
use your new product.

260
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
That means customers

261
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
have to overcome the switching cost

262
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
of switching from existing products to new products.

263
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
So now, as Ben Horowitz said,

264
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
either make a 10x product

265
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
or they won't switch.

266
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
In Zero to One as well,

267
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
this utility of 10x

268
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
kept staying in my head.

269
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Ultimately, it has to be that level

270
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
to overcome that switching cost. It's very similar to startups?

271
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
That's what I thought.

272
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Ultimately, whether it's a startup or AX,

273
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
from the perspective that you have to give customers

274
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
a product that creates 10x utility,

275
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
you can apply the startup

276
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
framework almost identically.

277
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
When going for market in startups,

278
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
what do they mainly talk about?

279
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It's important to absolutely choose a big market.

280
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
They talk about small markets,

281
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
but what is a market in AX?

282
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
What is it?

283
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
It's time.

284
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
That time is actually

285
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
the sizes of time spent

286
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
by organization and workflow category,

287
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
each different time is a different market.

288
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Those times are the market size.

289
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Ultimately, to succeed with limited resources

290
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
and maintain authority

291
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
from my leadership,

292
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
you have to choose a market with large transformational size.

293
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Like doing a startup.

294
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
So in startups, they always talk about MVP,

295
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
and naturally we

296
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
go through PoC and scale up.

297
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
That's how we're doing AX,

298
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
and it seems like a natural approach.

299
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
And

300
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
in startups, they talk a lot about finding PMF.

301
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
They say you've found PMF

302
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
only when customers actually pay money.

303
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
What does finding PMF mean in AX?

304
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
It's not just

305
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
"I tried it and it's good,"

306
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
but reaching a PoC level where you can't go back

307
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
to the original way.

308
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
And from a product marketing

309
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
perspective,

310
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
the customers are the organization members

311
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
who use my product.

312
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
These are laggards.

313
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Customers who know nothing about AI,

314
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
the marketing team.

315
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
They don't care about that.

316
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I fit the pieces to match people

317
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
and design the user flow

318
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
so that just thinking leads naturally to the end.

319
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You have to make it to that level

320
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
so they can't go back to the original way. That's finding PMF.

321
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
There are also investors.

322
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
In startups, naturally,

323
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
if VCs who invest when you prove cash are investors,

324
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
in AX,

325
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
who are the investors?

326
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Upper decision-makers.

327
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
While I'm being invested in,

328
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I have to prove ROI

329
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
for the resources I've consumed,

330
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
so upper decision-makers

331
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
will invest more in me.

332
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
There's also runway. In startups, when cash runs out, it's bankruptcy.

333
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
For the AX team,

334
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
what is runway organizational bankruptcy?

335
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Trust.

336
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Ultimately,

337
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
when trust from upper decision-makers hits rock bottom,

338
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
it's just bankruptcy.

339
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Your authority gets confiscated.

340
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
In terms of difficulty, everyone knows

341
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
succeeding in a startup is incredibly difficult,

342
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
but actually I see AX as the same difficulty level.

343
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Honestly, it's better to start a company than succeed at this.

344
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
At least you'd have money.

345
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
This has no money,

346
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
it's difficult, it's hard.

347
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It's this level of difficulty.

348
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Looking at it that way,

349
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
many people ask

350
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
why after doing PoC,

351
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
the next step doesn't go well.

352
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
It's an obvious thing to say. Naturally, you made an MVP,

353
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
but the tasks you need to do next

354
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
are as packed as in a startup.

355
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
AX is no different. PoC is when the real work

356
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
begins, so naturally,

357
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
PoC success absolutely doesn't

358
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
guarantee AX success.

359
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
From that perspective, if AX builders

360
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
are the same as entrepreneurs,

361
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
what combination of capabilities

362
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
is needed to succeed in AX?

363
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Today we have Echo and

364
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Delta meeting,

365
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
so there's Delta and Echo.

366
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
What I think is you need additional

367
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
capabilities beyond this. What is it?

368
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
The capabilities of PO and PM

369
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
all need to be combined to be truly

370
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
AX full-stack,

371
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
that's what I think. As a consultant,

372
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
the capability is naturally logic,

373
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
quickly breaking down problems,

374
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
structuring bottlenecks, establishing angles,

375
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
and iterating logic. But importantly,

376
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
you have to do it really fast.

377
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
As soon as you hear it, it breaks down, goes all the way, logic comes out,

378
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
you run it through agents,

379
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
and if results don't come out well, you come back.

380
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
You have to be able to do this really fast

381
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
to have capability as an AX consultant.

382
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Naturally, you also need capability

383
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
as a PO.

384
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
What kind of being are humans? You need to know how lazy they are

385
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
and how much they dislike things.

386
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
You need to have a sense for products

387
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
that people use,

388
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
and concepts about iteration,

389
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
and obsession about problems

390
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
to succeed again. I

391
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
learned a lot about this at doeat.

392
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Anyway, you need capability

393
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
as a PO with this kind of obsession.

394
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
You also need PM. Ultimately,

395
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
you have to persuade

396
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
uncooperative counterparties while doing AX.

397
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
My leadership

398
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
doesn't give much time,

399
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
so before hitting bottom, you have to pull the plane up,

400
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
managing schedules,

401
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
recovering while doing PoC and succeeding,

402
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
then the main project.

403
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
You need this capability as a PM.

404
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Actually, there's no difference

405
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
from entrepreneurs. It's better to start a company.

406
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
At least you'd have money.

407
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Anyway,

408
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
so then

409
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
thanks to that, when I thought about what

410
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
mindset to have when doing AX,

411
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
entrepreneurs think like this: nothing is

412
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
impossible in the world. I just couldn't find it. But

413
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
now we think it's impossible for AI,

414
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
and I just instructed it wrong.

415
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Having that mindset

416
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
and doing it persistently

417
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
is how you succeed. That's the capability set

418
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
that's needed, I think.

419
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
So there are 3 playbooks

420
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I want to talk about today.

421
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
First,

422
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
trying thin but end-to-end

423
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
makes it easier to quickly create PMF.

424
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
That's the first. Now interpreting with the startup

425
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
framework,

426
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
there's always a gap between expectation and reality,

427
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
and as a business person, I really

428
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
have to do this. At first,

429
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
when I visualized the workflow non-realistically,

430
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
everyone will follow this workflow

431
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
properly at the organizational level, but

432
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
that's absolutely not the case. Everyone

433
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
actually has their own workflow.

434
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
So after interviewing in more detail

435
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
and drawing charts, the workflows

436
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
for making proposals, everyone does it the same,

437
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
but they all look different. Actually,

438
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
because common denominators are absent,

439
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
any bottleneck in the workflow,

440
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
targeting a specific section,

441
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
is actually very difficult to succeed at.

442
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
So there's the approach of being thick

443
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
and doing part properly,

444
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
and from the perspective of trying thin but all the way to the end,

445
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I think the right side is better.

446
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Partially,

447
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
actually defining a certain section

448
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
as a bottleneck and doing AS

449
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
is actually targeting

450
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
some interviewees' bottleneck,

451
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
their real intersection,

452
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
so you're more likely to target

453
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
only a smaller market.

454
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
It doesn't become organizational AS.

455
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
But what we can trust about end-to-end

456
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
is this. It's not trusting the workflow,

457
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
but ultimately anyway,

458
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
workflows have inputs and outputs.

459
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
And everyone has to use

460
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
the same input in their own way

461
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
to make the same final output,

462
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
a proposal.

463
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
So when approaching end-to-end, organizational-level

464
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
AS is more likely. This is the truth.

465
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
This is actually not the truth.

466
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
And

467
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
second, if you choose even edge cases

468
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
and go thick and deep,

469
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
there's a very high possibility

470
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
of folding without even shipping MVP.

471
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Because

472
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
a month passes and you're not dead.

473
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Anyway,

474
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
so you made money.

475
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
What happened? They ask like that,

476
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
so in that sense, going thin

477
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
allows iteration loops to run really fast,

478
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
and there's a higher possibility

479
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
of discovering real problems there,

480
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I think.

481
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Going thin but end-to-end

482
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
was the first rule I learned. The second is

483
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
making it AI-Native from the beginning

484
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
makes it a bit easier to 10x.

485
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I think Elon Musk's

486
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
thinking is also valid for AX.

487
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Decompose complex problems

488
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
to the most basic, fundamental level.

489
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
That kind of thinking.

490
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Rockets are too expensive to make

491
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
at that price. But what are rockets

492
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
made of? The raw materials are like this?

493
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
They're not even expensive? Ultimately, what are the

494
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
fundamental costs needed for rocket manufacturing?

495
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Digging into that,

496
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
similarly, when doing AX in an organization,

497
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
there's a lot of work, many tasks,

498
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
it's hard. When you hear that,

499
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
rather than just believing it

500
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
and looking at that workflow exactly,

501
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
ultimately

502
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
since we're doing intellectual labor,

503
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
all our activities are about taking low-value information

504
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
and making it into high-value information.

505
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
That's all activities.

506
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
During the industrial revolution,

507
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
we escaped physical labor.

508
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Looking at it that way, ultimately creating

509
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
high-value information, all those acts

510
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
are what we do.

511
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Let's break down the process

512
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
where information value increases. When doing that,

513
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
if it's not people doing it but we entrust it to agents,

514
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
how many tasks can we eliminate?

515
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Erase all those,

516
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
and then partially automating the AX part

517
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
is much better.

518
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Rather than starting with human workflow,

519
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
trust only the output

520
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
and output of the work,

521
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
thinking about entrusting it to agents,

522
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
questioning the tasks

523
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
that people did as natural tasks,

524
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
and going AI-Native

525
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
by simply erasing everything

526
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
makes creating 10x much easier.

527
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
That's the second point. The last is

528
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
you have to become AX full-stack.

529
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Because ultimately,

530
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
before cash, before runway

531
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
all gets fixed,

532
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
before the balance of trust and

533
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
patience runs out,

534
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
to succeed, you ultimately need speed.

535
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
So

536
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
when they gave you time and a month passed, when they ask "what happened?"

537
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
some effect has to come out or transformation

538
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
has to happen to keep making investment

539
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
from the CEO.

540
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Looking at it, ultimately,

541
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
from an AX perspective,

542
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
you have to be full-stack to succeed.

543
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I'm only thinking about our organization.

544
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
In my case,

545
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I'm Echo but to become Delta,

546
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I'm trying Protex,

547
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
just like those of you

548
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
attending today,

549
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
there were many people
