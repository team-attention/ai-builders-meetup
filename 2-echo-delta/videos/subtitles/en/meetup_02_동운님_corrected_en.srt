00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello. I'm Dongwoon Choi. You can call me Colin.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm currently working at Samyang Foods.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Samyang Foods, Buldak is famous, but it seems far from AI.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
But I'll briefly share what I'm working on.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I titled it this way. What does this mean?

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I posted an article on LinkedIn.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Samyang Foods, Buldak is doing great, but who would want to come work as a software developer?

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
IT recruitment wasn't working. We were serious about it though.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So I started posting articles, and they did well.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
If you're curious, you can check out my LinkedIn.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
But I said our calculators were confiscated so we could only use Excel, so I brought that as the title.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
What this means is

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I came to Samyang Foods with a somewhat unique background.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And then

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
But suddenly

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
they're talking about digital IT and stuff.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
saying they want to build something.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So we need to deliver meaningful results by year-end.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
But we only have 6 months, there's me and a designer,

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and then there's that handsome long-haired gentleman sitting over there.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So we need to build something with just the three of us.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
At first, naturally we thought about outsourcing development.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So we met with all kinds of companies.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
But everyone was just trying to rip us off.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
These guys have money and know nothing.

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
These guys just have money.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
They both made a lot of money but now they're doing something weird.

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
They kept coming at us like that.

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So I thought, wow, we have no choice.

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The answer is to go the AI native path.

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Cursor and Claude Code are working so well.

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
There's no other way, let's quickly accept this.

33
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Let's accept it, and if it doesn't work, we'll just quit.

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And then we have no existing legacy.

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Manufacturing companies don't know anything about IT software development.

36
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So this is originally how we do it.

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I thought this would work.

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So let's go, and I started with Seongju sitting over there.

39
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So the three of us, including our designer, came to an agreement.

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Since we have no time and we're busy,

41
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
everything in code.

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Everyone uses Cursor and Claude Code.

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
No Figma, Notion, Jira, none of that crap.

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Everything through chat. That's how we started.

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So as we went on, what was really important was

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
let's throw away all the old ways.

47
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
If we don't throw it away, we can't survive.

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
We burned our bridges.

49
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
If we don't do this, we'll all quit anyway.

50
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
That's what we did.

51
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So as I mentioned earlier,

52
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
we gave up PRD, Figma, development, details, everything.

53
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Don't write meeting notes, we don't need that.

54
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
We only talk through builds.

55
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
We don't need anything but builds.

56
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Whether it's meeting notes or Figma files, code is what's real.

57
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
All those things never get updated anyway,

58
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
they were just painful.

59
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
What's the point of all that?

60
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
We can just communicate everything through code.

61
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So we only talk through builds,

62
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
only through code.

63
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Fortunately, both our designer and I,

64
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
we don't know how to code at all.

65
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
But we quickly accepted that there's no other way.

66
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Because we accepted it, we tried this approach.

67
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And it worked.

68
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So we actually built an MVP in one month

69
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
and launched a service targeting TikTok creators in the US market.

70
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So the company was surprised too.

71
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Oh, this could be done in one month?

72
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
So I said, yes, this is how it works.

73
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You don't need to pay much to outsiders.

74
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Just let us use a lot of tokens.

75
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
That's what I told them.

76
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
In that situation, a problem arose.

77
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Oh, how should I explain this?

78
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And then I realized something.

79
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
What are the core competencies? After trying it, I felt

80
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
exactly two things.

81
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Taste and judgment. That's what I found.

82
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
AI pours out answers incredibly fast, right?

83
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
So ultimately, what humans need to do is

84
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
is this right? Or wrong? You need to tell it precisely.

85
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Do I like this? Do I not like this? Or is it correct? Is it wrong?

86
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You need to communicate this.

87
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And especially when it comes to design,

88
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
there's the realm of taste.

89
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So we need to have clear taste.

90
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
And for development architecture and such things,

91
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
there's right and wrong.

92
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
So making those judgments quickly was important.

93
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
So whether you're a prompt engineer,

94
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
or can't use models, can't use MCP, none of that matters.

95
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
First, like us, switching your mindset is the best approach.

96
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
That's what we felt.

97
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
And fortunately, the three of us had enough

98
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
experience and capability to switch our mindset.

99
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So we proceeded with quick judgment and taste.

100
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
But then I ran into another issue.

101
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
The first month went well.

102
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
But as it became two months, three months,

103
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
gradually everyone's style started to differ.

104
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Individual techniques started to emerge.

105
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So as we started to diverge a bit,

106
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
we brought in freelancers to work with us.

107
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So about five or six people

108
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
started committing to GitHub, to the repo.

109
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And I thought, oh, I tried this and it works.

110
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So our team's data analysts

111
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
and other non-developer roles also started committing.

112
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So I just told them to do it.

113
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Then gradually it started becoming chaos.

114
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I think many of you have probably experienced this,

115
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
when multiple people use it, chaos ensues.

116
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So I thought, oh, we need systematization.

117
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
We need something.

118
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It was around September.

119
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
What should we do? Should we go back to the old ways?

120
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Because of this, should I go back to using Notion and Jira

121
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
and Figma that I used before?

122
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I was tempted.

123
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
One evening, I was eating at McDonald's,

124
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
and it suddenly hit me. Oh, this is it! This is it.

125
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Whether you eat McDonald's in Seoul Forest, Gangnam, or New York,

126
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
it's all the same, right? The Big Mac tastes the same everywhere.

127
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Couldn't we make it like that?

128
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
So McDonald's solved this problem the best, right?

129
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
That's what I thought.

130
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
So we decided to create a McDonald's franchise model.

131
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Here, the headquarters, branch manager, someone like Baek Jong-won,

132
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
the person who sends down manuals from franchise headquarters,

133
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
that's the Tech Lead sitting over there.

134
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
The rest of us, non-developers and non-engineers,

135
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
we just manage our branches as branch managers.

136
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
And the part-timers there are just coding agents.

137
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
That's the idea.

138
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
So we proceeded this way.

139
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
The workflow principles can't be complex because we can't understand it, so it's very simple.

140
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Number 1, gather everything into one context.

141
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
We have two things we call Source of Truth.

142
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
One is we record all meetings

143
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
and after recording, we dump everything into Google Notebook LM.

144
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
We didn't have time to build legacy systems.

145
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So Google Notebook LM, let's just use what's available quickly.

146
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
We dump everything into the repo and Notebook LM.

147
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
All the meeting notes are in there.

148
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
So why we're trying to do this work,

149
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
if you throw a prompt into Notebook LM, it tells you.

150
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
We start work from there.

151
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
And for deliverables, we really don't use Notion, Figma, Jira.

152
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Nothing. Only GitHub.

153
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
So we gather everything in GitHub.

154
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
So this is how we created our McDonald's.

155
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You can see our signature menu items like Start Feature and such.

156
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
We've broken everything down.

157
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And when it comes to how McDonald's maintains uniformity,

158
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
if one part-timer had to make a Big Mac, everyone would do it differently.

159
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
But someone only takes orders, someone only toasts buns, someone only cooks patties.

160
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
That's how they maintain uniformity.

161
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
We actually saved a lot on token costs.

162
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
We used a lot of tokens and thought it wasn't good.

163
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Too expensive. And slow. The higher the model.

164
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
If you break it down like this, cheap and fast models can run quickly, quickly, quickly.

165
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Speed was really, really important for us.

166
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
So we broke it down like this and used cheap and fast models.

167
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Things like Cursor's Composer are so fast.

168
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Really great. We just run it quickly and use it.

169
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
That's how we did it.

170
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
As we went on, it's fast to say too, right?

171
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'll take my time and speak quickly.

172
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
So we did mergers and acquisitions.

173
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
We had multiple repositories.

174
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
McDonald's wasn't there, it was in the app we made before.

175
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
And there were several other agents or different types of repos.

176
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
But we realized this.

177
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Oh, we need to merge and acquire a lot into McDonald's.

178
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Let's go with a monorepo.

179
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
We merged all the multiple repositories into one.

180
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Analysis that analysts used, Agent that analysts used,

181
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
our app, we bundled everything together.

182
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
After bundling, now all the context is in here, everyone's stuff is in here.

183
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Based on this, we pull out what we need and use it.

184
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
As we did this, whoever comes can do it right away.

185
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Since full-time hiring is nearly impossible for us,

186
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
we have no choice but to use freelancers.

187
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
We're working with Goobong's team.

188
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Kwontae sitting over there, Jake, as soon as he came, he immediately did Start Feature.

189
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
On the first day, he just built a feature right away.

190
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
As a freelancer.

191
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Oh right, this is it. This is McDonald's.

192
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
When you work part-time at McDonald's, you start working right away on the first day.

193
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
We really, really needed to make it like that.

194
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
In a reality where full-time hiring is impossible, this is all we can do.

195
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
So we went this way.

196
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
So in conclusion, there are several things I can say,

197
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
but the biggest thing is first, going to an environment where I have no choice but to throw away my old ways.

198
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
That's what it is.

199
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
If I had 10 engineers on the team, I can clearly tell I would never have done this.

200
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
We're doing this because we don't have them on the team.

201
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Second, just close your mind and just build something first.

202
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Anyway, in a world where there are no right answers regarding AI, trying it is the most important.

203
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Third, the era of dividing engineers and non-engineers is over.

204
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
This is too old-fashioned. Everyone writes code. All 12 out of 12 on our team can write code.

205
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Because it's not code,

206
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
you can talk in Korean too.

207
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So you can use Korean.

208
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
So give everyone a Cursor project and if you're frustrated, you build it.

209
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
There was something from the earlier presentation, right?

210
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
If you're frustrated, you build it. That's really good.

211
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
And we put everything into our monorepo, merged it with McDonald's,

212
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
so pick out the prompts and elements in there and build what you want.

213
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
That's the essence of it.

214
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
That's it.

215
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
The end.
