1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,679
This is my first time sitting and having a talk show like this.

2
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:08,520
So I hope you enjoy the show,

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:12,640
We have our first question today.

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,640
Our first question is,

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:21,600
In today's presentations, we heard a lot about how Echo Delta specifically uses AI well,

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,600
The first question is,

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,239
Actually, each of you uses AI so well.

8
00:00:28,799 --> 00:00:34,319
So I'm curious from what moment you started using it well.

9
00:00:34,319 --> 00:00:37,919
Because, after all, we're doing work,

10
00:00:37,919 --> 00:00:39,919
And work has inertia.

11
00:00:39,919 --> 00:00:42,400
There are ways I've always worked,

12
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,000
But working with AI means you have to let go of those ways.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,040
So what was that moment like,

14
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,400
I'm curious about that,

15
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,040
And since Seojin is making eye contact right now,

16
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,840
Seojin will react first.

17
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:06,639
I previously worked at a company called Boors as an AI product engineer,

18
00:01:06,639 --> 00:01:12,000
What was funny was, there was no designer, no frontend engineer, no backend engineer,

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I was supposed to develop features alone.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,720
What? They don't give me Figma?

21
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:22,160
So I met directly with decision-makers to listen,

22
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:25,839
And had to ship features in a short period,

23
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:29,120
That's when I first started using it to the max,

24
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:33,599
Second, as I coded like crazy with AI,

25
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:37,040
I got scolded a lot in code reviews.

26
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,040
So I didn't want to get scolded anymore.

27
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,400
So, ah, Claude Code produces better results,

28
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:50,400
That's when I switched to the second code and started using it much more.

29
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,400
Yes, that's right.

30
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,360
Dongun, what about you?

31
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,360
Mine is a bit similar,

32
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,879
Seojin didn't have colleagues to collaborate with.

33
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:10,639
I think it was a situation where I received an unreasonable request.

34
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:15,759
Once I was out at an external meetup,

35
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:20,160
And my boss's boss said to me,

36
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,720
We have many cases, how about writing a blog post?

37
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,720
That's what they said.

38
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,720
I said okay, I'll do it next Monday.

39
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,720
It was Friday then.

40
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,720
I think it was Thursday or Friday.

41
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,720
So you said next Monday?

42
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,720
Can't you do it earlier?

43
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,679
That's how challenges come to me.

44
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:44,639
So doing that,

45
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:48,639
I'm at this meetup right now but I need to do something.

46
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:51,679
And there wasn't just one case back then.

47
00:02:51,679 --> 00:02:54,639
I didn't think they'd ask me to write just one blog.

48
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:56,639
Instinctively.

49
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:01,679
So I need to quickly make an agent that can mass-produce blogs.

50
00:03:01,679 --> 00:03:03,679
I had all the transcribed scripts anyway.

51
00:03:03,679 --> 00:03:06,639
So I went to that meetup,

52
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:08,639
Opened Anthropic Workbench,

53
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:10,639
Did about 19 steps,

54
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:12,639
That agent, single agent,

55
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:14,639
Kept building up the prompt.

56
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:16,639
Then looked at the output,

57
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:18,639
Had people review it,

58
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:20,639
Gave feedback,

59
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:22,639
When the prompt improved with feedback,

60
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:24,639
Ran it about 10 times,

61
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:26,639
Then something came out.

62
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:28,639
So,

63
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:32,639
On Friday, I just churned out 3 blog posts,

64
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:34,639
About 70-point blogs

65
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:36,639
I remember writing like that.

66
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:38,639
So we,

67
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:40,639
The blogs we saw,

68
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,639
Human,

69
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:46,639
Ah,

70
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:48,639
There was some final touch,

71
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:50,639
But actually,

72
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:52,639
Almost like that.

73
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:54,639
It's a speed humans can't achieve.

74
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:56,639
I really relate to that,

75
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:58,639
I also use Claude Code,

76
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,639
What's called multi-Clauding,

77
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:02,639
Opening multiple sessions,

78
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:04,639
Running features across worktrees,

79
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:06,639
Making things while wondering what they are,

80
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:08,639
That process,

81
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:10,639
I first did when I received an unreasonable request.

82
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:12,639
Really.

83
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:14,639
At the company I was working for then,

84
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,640
A new vice president joined,

85
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,640
The vice president called me,

86
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,640
Hey, go next week,

87
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,640
And present to the client.

88
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,640
Ah, I'm presenting?

89
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,640
Then who's making it?

90
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,640
Hey, I'm the one making it.

91
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,640
If I make it, I have to present it,

92
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,640
With 3 days left.

93
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,640
That's when it was really intense,

94
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,640
That's when something,

95
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,640
Felt like a point of no return.

96
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,640
I felt that too,

97
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,640
Geonho, what about you?

98
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,640
Very similar,

99
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,640
Experience,

100
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,640
I also found it interesting while listening,

101
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,640
Uh,

102
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,640
Constraints create innovative thinking.

103
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,640
I think.

104
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,640
For me now,

105
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,640
This event happened during my probation period,

106
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,640
Actually,

107
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,640
Starting out,

108
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,640
Ah, I want to execute. I want to join a startup.

109
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,640
I had gathered all my vacation days,

110
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,640
So I had exactly one week

111
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,640
To go through the probation period.

112
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,640
But now,

113
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,640
To pass,

114
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,640
One more experiment needed to be done within a week,

115
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,640
And then,

116
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,640
Run SQL queries,

117
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,640
Do BA,

118
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,640
Complete all the analysis,

119
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,640
All within a week,

120
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,640
I only knew SELECT FROM WHERE,

121
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,640
At that level,

122
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,640
Suddenly had to join all sorts of tables,

123
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,640
What, calculate delivery time and what,

124
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,640
Had to calculate retention,

125
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,640
So for me it was like,

126
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,640
Make a computer in a week without a calculator,

127
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,640
That's what it felt like,

128
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,640
That's when I had a wow moment.

129
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,640
So it was GPT 3.5 back then,

130
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,640
Actually not good at reasoning, but anyway,

131
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,640
For queries,

132
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,640
The performance was already incredible,

133
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,640
Of course it's close to coding,

134
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,640
That's when I felt wow,

135
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,640
And then started

136
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,640
Following up more seriously.

137
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,640
On AI technology.

138
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,640
Naturally.

139
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,640
My presentation content is actually,

140
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,640
About that.

141
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,640
Right.

142
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,640
Just,

143
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,640
If you do work you can't do without AI,

144
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,640
You'll use it. That's really true.

145
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,640
If you do work you can do without AI,

146
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,640
People don't use it.

147
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,640
I think so.

148
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,640
I've worked closely with

149
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,640
The design team,

150
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,640
So there's an interesting case

151
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,640
I'd like you to share,

152
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,640
When the designer,

153
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,640
Was seeking,

154
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,640
And made something while watching,

155
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,640
Please tell us more about that.

156
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,640
That's similar too. If you don't let them use Figma,

157
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,640
They work like that. Really.

158
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,640
If you say you've done everything,

159
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,640
And there's no time to use Figma,

160
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,640
And they say they won't do it,

161
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,640
That makes a big difference.

162
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,640
So,

163
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,640
Perks at the end of the year, you know.

164
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,640
Now we,

165
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,640
Since we use Claude Code perks together,

166
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,640
There were no talks but,

167
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,640
Our designer,

168
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,640
Was in the top 44% worldwide.

169
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,640
A designer, but beat 56%

170
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,640
Of developers worldwide.

171
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,640
For design systems and such,

172
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,640
No need for Figma.

173
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,640
They put everything in code,

174
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,640
Everything. Anyway, if you open the build and look,

175
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,640
That's the truth.

176
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,640
Like Storybook.

177
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,640
If you don't buy Figma,

178
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,640
No time to use Figma.

179
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,640
Figma stock might not do well.

180
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,640
I think so.

181
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,640
If you try Figma to code,

182
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,640
Not everything in Figma is in the code.

183
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,640
What really surprised me,

184
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,640
Just now,

185
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,640
The case I asked about,

186
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,640
During a sync we were having,

187
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,640
That time, the designer

188
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,640
Brought a mockup.

189
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,640
But this was almost just,

190
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,640
Actually working.

191
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,640
So, huh? Did you,

192
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,640
Develop this directly in code?

193
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,640
I thought,

194
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,640
But when I looked at the screen, it was Google AI Studio.

195
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,640
Google AI Studio,

196
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,640
But it looked exactly like our actual popup service.

197
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,640
The appearance.

198
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,640
So I asked how they did it,

199
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,640
Used Cursor to extract CSS and,

200
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,640
Index files and all that,

201
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,640
Put it in AI Studio like that,

202
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,640
And it came out looking exactly the same,

203
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,640
And the designer,

204
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,640
Added buttons like this and this,

205
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,640
Then next screen should go like this.

206
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,640
Made all the screens,

207
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,640
And they all worked.

208
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,640
So I just looked at that,

209
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,640
Synced, and went straight to development.

210
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,640
So fresh,

211
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,640
So fun.

212
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,640
Connecting a bit,

213
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,640
I also have a case that comes to mind,

214
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,640
This, in a way,

215
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,640
In an organization,

216
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,640
This could work,

217
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,640
If you confiscate calculators,

218
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,640
Anyway, it's a bit closer to code,

219
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,640
And they've heard of Claude Code,

220
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,640
But for me,

221
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,640
For non-developer organizations,

222
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,640
Sales teams, education consultant teams,

223
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,640
Teams that work hard on PPTs,

224
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,640
And meet customers,

225
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,640
I tried various things,

226
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,640
My style is also pretty strong,

227
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,640
So at first I wanted to confiscate,

228
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,640
Something,

229
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,640
But first the target isn't very clear.

230
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,640
So if you confiscate PPT,

231
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,640
Will they use Canva?

232
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,640
It almost doesn't become like that.

233
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,640
Sales, SaaS, tools we're using,

234
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,640
If you confiscate that, will they make dashboards directly?

235
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,640
For such non-developers,

236
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,640
It's hard to clearly calculate BAT,

237
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,640
That's the difficult point.

238
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,640
Second,

239
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,640
As I mentioned before

240
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,640
In distribution,

241
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,640
This is general,

242
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,640
In other job functions,

243
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,640
Should I call it familiarity?

244
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,640
More than you think,

245
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,640
There's a bigger gap than we think,

246
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,640
What shocked me was,

247
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,640
I,

248
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,640
Run deep search,

249
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,640
Then make a storyline for the proposal,

250
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,640
Make a GPT,

251
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,640
Create proposal content,

252
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,640
Keep using it like this,

253
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,640
So I should train this internally,

254
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,640
I thought.

255
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,640
Did internal training,

256
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,640
Wrote the prompt framework almost on the board.

257
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,640
It's not difficult.

258
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,640
Just write as on the board.

259
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,640
Before pressing enter,

260
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,640
Each person leave your prompt on Slack

261
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,640
As a comment.

262
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,640
Gave them 5 minutes,

263
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,640
No one left Slack comments.

264
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,640
Don't be shy,

265
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,640
Just write what you don't know as is.

266
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,640
Look at that and ride along.

267
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,640
But no one ran it,

268
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,640
So I went around,

269
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,640
The meeting room.

270
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,640
But some people,

271
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,640
Were frozen.

272
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,640
Couldn't write one sentence.

273
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,640
But I was shocked.

274
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,640
Just write what's on the board as is.

275
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,640
From Google, from Naver,

276
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,640
Just copy-paste 3 KT new technology articles.

277
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,640
But there,

278
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,640
They stopped,

279
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,640
I had many thoughts.

280
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,640
And somewhat,

281
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,640
The confiscation method,

282
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,640
Could be big trouble,

283
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,640
I thought.

284
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,640
For non-developer organizations,

285
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,640
I think that's the result.

286
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,640
Such a good story.

287
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,640
Then,

288
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,640
Since confiscation is a bit harsh,

289
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,640
Before the next question,

290
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,640
You two seem to be getting too much light,

291
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,640
Shall we sit a bit forward?

292
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,640
Saved your eyesight.

293
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,640
Confiscation,

294
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,640
Is a harsh term,

295
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,640
So changing to the word unlearn,

296
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,640
A bit,

297
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,640
To work well with AI,

298
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,640
Specifically,

299
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,640
What skillsets or,

300
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,640
What mindsets should we unlearn?

301
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,640
And,

302
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,640
Conversely, things good to learn,

303
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,640
Things we must learn,

304
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,640
Things we must learn,

305
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,640
What are they?

306
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,640
What does each of you think,

307
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,640
Well,

308
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,640
To put it briefly,

309
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,640
There's nothing it can't do,

310
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,640
But,

311
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,640
It's just that I can't make it do it,

312
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,640
That mindset,

313
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,640
I think we should make all media have it,

314
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,640
But how that gets learned,

315
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,640
How that mindset is built,

316
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,640
I don't really know,

317
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,640
I set up an AX team,

318
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,640
We just matched

319
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,640
Smart people,

320
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,640
They don't know n8n, don't know anything.

321
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,640
But, on LinkedIn,

322
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,640
n8n workflows,

323
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,640
About 6,000 cases in JSON

324
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,640
Were uploaded on GitHub,

325
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,640
So I said,

326
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,640
Let's use this later.

327
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,640
If it were me, I would have done it like this.

328
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,640
I did it like this,

329
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,640
But that person doesn't know Python,

330
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,640
Asked GPT,

331
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,640
How do I extract all JSONs from a folder?

332
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,640
Python code came out.

333
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,640
Then the question was, I don't know Python.

334
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,640
Tell me how to do it on Windows.

335
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,640
So,

336
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,640
I don't know if PowerShell was suggested,

337
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,640
Extracted all JSONs from folders,

338
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,640
Read the text in them,

339
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,640
Through GPT extracted

340
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,640
Workflows worth referencing,

341
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,640
Let's reference these 6 for our project.

342
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,640
Brought those words.

343
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,640
I was shocked then.

344
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,640
This mindset,

345
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,640
Is the starting point.

346
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,640
Shall we go in order?

347
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,640
Shall I go?

348
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,640
That result earlier,

349
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,640
That story really resonated,

350
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,640
Thinking only result-oriented,

351
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,640
Is necessary.

352
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,640
Forget all about the process,

353
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,640
For example, if we're climbing a mountain,

354
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,640
The path humans take and the path AI takes are different.

355
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,640
I've found.

356
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,640
It's felt a lot.

357
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,640
So need to reach the summit,

358
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,640
Need to reach basecamp in the middle,

359
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,640
Just mark a few points,

360
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,640
Better to forget all the paths, I think.

361
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,640
And what needs to be learned,

362
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,640
Result-oriented thinking.

363
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,640
Mark only results accurately,

364
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,640
The process,

365
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,640
The workflow I knew,

366
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,640
Anyway,

367
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,640
As shown earlier,

368
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,640
Everyone is different.

369
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,640
And my method isn't the answer,

370
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,640
There's always a better method,

371
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,640
And I won't be doing that,

372
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,640
So do it the way I'm good at, often,

373
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,640
Mark results accurately,

374
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,640
Forget all processes.

375
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,640
And what needs to be learned is result-oriented,

376
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,640
How to specify results,

377
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,640
Understanding what my desires are, what I want,

378
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,640
I think these are important.

379
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,640
If I talk about our company case,

380
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,640
It might be helpful,

381
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,640
What should we unlearn?

382
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,640
From that perspective,

383
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,640
Our company is,

384
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,640
Running a program called job expansion.

385
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,640
A kind of product engineer

386
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,640
Cultivation program,

387
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,640
I also tried backend development,

388
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,640
Frontend development a bit,

389
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,640
Android development,

390
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,640
These things for about a week,

391
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,640
Complete a bootcamp-like thing,

392
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,640
Actual Android tickets come in,

393
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,640
Work on those tasks,

394
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,640
Can do these,

395
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,640
Haven't tried yet.

396
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,640
But actually running these programs,

397
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,640
iOS developers

398
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,640
Doing backend development,

399
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,640
Sending PRs,

400
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,640
And backend developers

401
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,640
Doing frontend development,

402
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,640
Sending PRs, doing these things.

403
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,640
But previously,

404
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,640
Frontend specific modules,

405
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,640
Functional organizations developing specific screens,

406
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,640
Receiving PRs,

407
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,640
Extremely low quality,

408
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,640
Shouldn't be used,

409
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,640
Plastered with,

410
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,640
PRs being sent,

411
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,640
PR comments

412
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,640
130, 140,

413
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,640
So they came to me from there.

414
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,640
This doesn't match code conventions,

415
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,640
Anti-pattern,

416
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,640
No need for such complex algorithm,

417
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,640
Things like this.

418
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,640
But I think

419
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,640
We need some meta-cognition about that.

420
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,640
Do result-oriented thinking,

421
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,640
What's the bottleneck there,

422
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,640
You yourself need to

423
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,640
Recognize a bit,

424
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,640
That's probably the point of unlearning,

425
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,640
The point where unlearning should happen,

426
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,640
I thought.

427
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,640
Of course,

428
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,640
Me doing it,

429
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,640
And making others do it,

430
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,640
Are really different parts.

431
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,640
And, what needs to be learned,

432
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,640
I actually have that too.

433
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,640
I try my best

434
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,640
Not to be a bottleneck,

435
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,640
Wanting to work like

436
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,640
100x, 1000x superman,

437
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,640
But I also can't let go,

438
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,640
Because of that,

439
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,640
I feel I'm becoming a bottleneck a lot.

440
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,640
So if I want to

441
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,640
Do more here,

442
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,640
What should I do,

443
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,640
Actually it's a bit similar perspective.

444
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,640
What to let go,

445
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,640
Then things to learn emerge.

446
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,640
I'm focusing much more

447
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,640
On unlearning.

448
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,640
In that sense.

449
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,640
My thinking is similar,

450
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,640
Ultimately why,

451
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,640
Can't we unlearn,

452
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,640
If you think about it,

453
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,640
The development speed of tools

454
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,640
Wasn't that fast,

455
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,640
Under that premise,

456
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,640
Continuously using these tools

457
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,640
The same way to get familiar,

458
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,640
Ultimately became better

459
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,640
At using the tools,

460
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,640
So people didn't switch tools

461
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,640
That quickly.

462
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,640
But, ultimately letting go of that

463
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,640
Tool-using inertia,

464
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,640
Continuously when new things

465
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,640
Come out,

466
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,640
Having the habit of experimenting,

467
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,640
Rather,

468
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,640
Letting go of that habit,

469
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,640
And trying,

470
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,640
Should be learned,

471
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,640
I thought.

472
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,640
Really resonate,

473
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,640
This morning,

474
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,640
I,

475
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,640
Sent text messages

476
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,640
To everyone coming today.

477
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,640
How did I do it at home,

478
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,640
To Gemini,

479
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,640
Hey, mass send text messages,

480
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,640
All at once,

481
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,640
But, if sent as group message,

482
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,640
Recipients shouldn't know each other.

483
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,640
Asked how to do it,

484
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,640
With MacBook shortcuts and,

485
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,640
Contacts and such,

486
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,640
Made some workflow,

487
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,640
Said it would send one by one.

488
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,640
I tried it,

489
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,640
But it didn't work. I tested,

490
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,640
It just sent as group chat.

491
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,640
So frustrated,

492
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,640
Next meeting no time,

493
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,640
So just asked Claude Code,

494
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,640
Hey, right now,

495
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,640
Today's meetup day,

496
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,640
I had the CSV list.

497
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,640
Can you,

498
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,640
Send text messages?

499
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,640
As soon as I asked,

500
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,640
I wrote Apps Script completely,

501
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,640
And sent it right away.

502
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,640
So,

503
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,640
I realized again today.

504
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,640
Ah, just from the beginning,

505
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,640
I'll ask Claude Code.

506
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,640
Not just ask,

507
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,640
I'll ask it to do it.

508
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,640
I'll whine about it.

509
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,640
I thought like this,

510
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,640
And realized once again.

511
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,640
This is really powerful.

512
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,640
Prompting is really powerful.

513
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,640
I came to think.

514
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,640
Probably even this,

515
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,640
Screen turning off issue,

516
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,640
I asked Claude Code.

517
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,640
Really Claude Code is all you need,

518
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,640
I really often think.

519
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,640
AI is greatly,

520
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,640
Advancing,

521
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,640
But Claude Code tool itself is also,

522
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,640
So good,

523
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,640
AI models keep getting better,

524
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,640
As you mentioned,

525
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,640
Tools themselves are also tremendously

526
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,640
Improving in performance,

527
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,640
I'm just curious about these things.

528
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,640
Personally,

529
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,640
I use this tool

530
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,640
To this extreme extent.

531
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,640
I'm pretty good at this.

532
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,640
Stories like this,

533
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,640
I'm curious,

534
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,640
Seojin,

535
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,640
Do you have a story to share?

536
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,640
What I know,

537
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,640
People who really use Claude Code well,

538
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,640
There are so many.

539
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,640
What can I talk about?

540
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,640
I think everyone's similar.

541
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,640
So obviously,

542
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,640
Deployment or,

543
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,640
Development-related,

544
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,640
Most things,

545
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,640
All done with Claude Code,

546
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,640
And preparing today's presentation,

547
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,640
On the way here,

548
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,640
Wanted to receive script or expected Q&A,

549
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,640
So,

550
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,640
Wrote Q&A about my Claude Code system,

551
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,640
Sent it by email to receive,

552
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,640
Actually there's that.

553
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,640
I do UI, UX,

554
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,640
Design generation itself

555
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,640
Through Claude Code,

556
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,640
But,

557
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,640
How did I design the function called generate design,

558
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,640
I asked,

559
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,640
Like Figma to code

560
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,640
Agents,

561
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,640
Your design generation

562
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,640
Iterative process and,

563
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,640
Feedback loop parameters,

564
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,640
Prompted to tell me,

565
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,640
Implemented that as function,

566
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,640
Then Gemini is best

567
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,640
At design generation,

568
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,640
So with Gemini CLI or,

569
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,640
Gemini API do design generation,

570
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,640
Designing.

571
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,640
I'm designing like that.

572
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,640
Expert,

573
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,640
Hacking,

574
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,640
As I mentioned,

575
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,640
Doing hacking.

576
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,640
One more thing,

577
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,640
Trying hard to speak,

578
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,640
While not listening,

579
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,640
Wanting to do panel talk well,

580
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,640
I'm trying to share

581
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,640
Some cases,

582
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,640
I'm an AX consultant,

583
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,640
As Echo,

584
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,640
How do I use it,

585
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,640
I use Codex.

586
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,640
The reason I use it,

587
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,640
I've been paying for GPT Pro,

588
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,640
So more token quota,

589
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,640
I'm using Codex,

590
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,640
Ultimately analyzing customers,

591
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,640
Writing proposals,

592
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,640
Or when needing new logic,

593
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,640
Ultimately,

594
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,640
Claude Code has something called skills,

595
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,640
You use that.

596
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,640
But,

597
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,640
Ultimately for me,

598
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,640
All work tacit knowledge existing in the world,

599
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,640
For non-developer jobs,

600
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,640
All work tacit knowledge can actually be

601
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,640
Made as sentences, as explicit knowledge,

602
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,640
Actually that explicit knowledge is all in

603
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,640
LLMs,

604
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,640
So even if I'm not a marketer,

605
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,640
Not a content marketer,

606
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,640
As an LLM developer,

607
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,640
Even not knowing how pretty to make this web,

608
00:22:46,640 --> 00:09:48,640
Ultimately running deep search,

609
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,640
Skillsets formalized as explicit knowledge

610
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,640
All contained and come out.

611
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,640
So I,

612
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,640
When needing to do some work,

613
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,640
Deep search,

614
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,640
Open about 20 GPT tabs,

615
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,640
For work I need to do,

616
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,640
Knowledge sets that might be needed,

617
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,640
For those,

618
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,640
Create research content.

619
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,640
Run about 20 deep searches.

620
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,640
While running about 20,

621
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,640
Need to start work,

622
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,640
As consultant, knowledge needed for problems,

623
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,640
Roughly from here to here if we collect all,

624
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,640
It's all contained,

625
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,640
Get the sense roughly,

626
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,640
Extract all as explicit knowledge,

627
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,640
Connect all to GPT or Gems'

628
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,640
Knowledge,

629
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,640
With all this knowledge,

630
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,640
Let's create first logic,

631
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,640
Start problem-solving.

632
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,640
Rather than thinking with my head,

633
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,640
Thinking with my head to

634
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,640
Create logic,

635
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,640
Tacit knowledge I don't know,

636
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,640
Not through interviews,

637
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,640
Using deep search like McKinsey feeling,

638
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,640
Utilizing.

639
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,640
So my wife is shocked.

640
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,640
Stop using GPT so much,

641
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,640
20 Chrome tabs,

642
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,640
20 GPT,

643
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,640
20 Gemini tabs,

644
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,640
40, 15,

645
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,640
Running like that,

646
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,640
So my wife just,

647
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,640
Anyone else?

648
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,640
Need to do each one.

649
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,640
Not knowing McKinsey,

650
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,640
We use Cursor a lot,

651
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,640
The reason we use Cursor,

652
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,640
We,

653
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,640
Working under time pressure,

654
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,640
Actually Cursor with Claude Agent and,

655
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,640
Then in Slack,

656
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,640
Made Slack bot,

657
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,640
Before Claude Code.

658
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,640
Going back and forth,

659
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,640
Ultimately in Slack mentioning Cursor,

660
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,640
Making it work,

661
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,640
Is so good,

662
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,640
As you saw, what we do.

663
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,640
Just @Cursor do this,

664
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,640
So much becomes done,

665
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,640
Slack thread takes context as is and brings it,

666
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,640
We McDonaldized it,

667
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,640
Made a guide,

668
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,640
Anyway people tell it what they'd tell it as is,

669
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,640
If you look at our Slack channel,

670
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,640
@Cursor and,

671
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,640
It's all on Slack.

672
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,640
That probably,

673
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,640
Hearing other stories,

674
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,640
That's one reason we can't go to Claude Code.

675
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,640
But earlier we did McDonald's menu,

676
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,640
Menu actually,

677
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,640
After making menus,

678
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,640
Next month Claude Code skills came out.

679
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,640
Very similar actually, the perspective itself.

680
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,640
Claude Code skills guide,

681
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,640
Skills making guide,

682
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,640
Brought our menu guide as is,

683
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,640
McDonald's menu making guide is actually Claude Code skills.

684
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,640
So now,

685
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,640
Almost one-to-one correspondence,

686
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,640
Those things are,

687
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,640
We worked hard.

688
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,640
Since such people exist,

689
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,640
Claude probably got inspired, I also thought.

690
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,640
But what we use most,

691
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,640
Cursor, daytime and weekends,

692
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,640
@Cursor please do,

693
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,640
Especially since we work with US,

694
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,640
US team members

695
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,640
Say something in English.

696
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,640
There @Cursor,

697
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,640
Fix this,

698
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,640
That's the best.

699
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,640
Earlier everyone was using so well,

700
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,640
I just,

701
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,640
Cutely,

702
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,640
How I use it,

703
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,640
Will briefly tell you,

704
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,640
For me now making

705
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,640
Presentation materials is very,

706
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,640
Stressful.

707
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,640
Not me making presentation materials,

708
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,640
Making others make presentation materials is stressful.

709
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,640
Usually,

710
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,640
With developers,

711
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,640
And designers,

712
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,640
Slide quality,

713
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,640
Is very obviously different.

714
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,640
Developers really only have text.

715
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,640
But this needs to be imported.

716
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,640
That's so stressful.

717
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,640
So these days how I do it,

718
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,640
First our,

719
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,640
Mockup program or training,

720
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,640
When cases come out,

721
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,640
First schedule 30-minute interview.

722
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,640
Even if offline meeting face-to-face,

723
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,640
Must Google Meet,

724
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,640
Join please turn on mic.

725
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,640
Join, transcribe, record.

726
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,640
Take transcribed script as is,

727
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,640
Send to Claude PT,

728
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,640
Gamma receives well,

729
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,640
There's a format.

730
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,640
Slide content,

731
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,640
Just pick sentences,

732
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,640
And between slides,

733
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,640
Just separate with 3 dashes,

734
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,640
Then now,

735
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,640
That becomes separated as

736
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,640
Plain text for one slide.

737
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,640
Just wrap that in code block,

738
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,640
Ask to extract one,

739
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,640
Those slides,

740
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,640
Just copyable form,

741
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,640
Come out as code block.

742
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,640
Copy that as is,

743
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,640
To Gamma make from plain text.

744
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,640
Then now paste,

745
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,640
Just generate,

746
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,640
Slides I want come out as is,

747
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,640
Then now after 30-minute meeting,

748
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,640
I roughly,

749
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,640
Did so many such meetings,

750
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,640
Roughly what flow of questions,

751
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,640
Need to extract I know.

752
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,640
Ask questions well, receive answers well,

753
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,640
And with that,

754
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,640
About 10 minutes after meeting ends,

755
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,640
Slides come out.

756
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,640
Doing it like that.

757
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,640
Using so well.

758
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,640
I'll also brag one thing,

759
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,640
This is a pattern I discovered

760
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,640
While looking at screen with Seojin,

761
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,640
Also saw Jonghyeon's pattern,

762
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,640
Some,

763
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,640
Development,

764
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,640
Projects,

765
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,640
So multiple repositories get created.

766
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,640
Multiple repositories created,

767
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,640
Put these as submodules,

768
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,640
Put them,

769
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,640
Make upper repository and use it.

770
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,640
What this means,

771
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,640
Each development project,

772
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,640
Or something shared,

773
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,640
Archiving repository,

774
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,640
All good,

775
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,640
Wrap all this,

776
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,640
Contexts wrapping all this clearly exist.

777
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,640
For example,

778
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,640
In our team,

779
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,640
Our team,

780
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,640
Our team uses these words.

781
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,640
Our team members are these people.

782
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,640
Our mission is this,

783
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,640
OKRs are this,

784
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,640
All sorts of projects we're doing are these projects,

785
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,640
Decision records so far are these things,

786
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,640
As MD file just,

787
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,640
As repository,

788
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,640
Manage as file system.

789
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,640
Beneath that,

790
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,640
Make projects folder,

791
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,640
Put all development projects or,

792
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,640
Open source projects.

793
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,640
And Claude Code,

794
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,640
At the very top,

795
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,640
Turn it on here,

796
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,640
All context known here,

797
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,640
With ability to know all, downward,

798
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,640
Spread Claude Code.

799
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,640
So now,

800
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,640
That homepage displayed,

801
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,640
Just separately,

802
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,640
Without putting in projects,

803
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,640
Just the homepage I want to make,

804
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,640
For,

805
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,640
Tell some style,

806
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,640
Who our team members are,

807
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,640
Who each one is,

808
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,640
Make it.

809
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,640
Deploy to Vercel.

810
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,640
Deployed at once.

811
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,640
That kind of,

812
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,640
Context,

813
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,640
Extreme usage patterns,

814
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,640
I really,

815
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,640
Myself very,

816
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,640
Thought this is something,

817
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,640
But Seojin hyung was already doing it,

818
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,640
This something is really a pattern,

819
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,640
I think,

820
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,640
Think proudly of this,

821
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,640
So far we,

822
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,640
Had some talk.

823
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,640
Originally tried to do

824
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,640
4 questions like this,

825
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,640
Time flowed more fun,

826
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,640
Continuing right away,

827
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,640
Let's hear

828
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,640
Questions directly.

829
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,640
I'll slightly,

830
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,640
Probably,

831
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,640
Questions,

832
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,640
Were written,

833
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,640
I wonder.

834
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,640
If there are definitely questions.

835
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,640
Questions then,

836
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,640
From here a bit,

837
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,640
So many?

838
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,640
Touching.

839
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,640
This last night,

840
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,640
Geontae made quickly,

841
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,640
I gave Geontae simple,

842
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,640
Requirements prompt,

843
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,640
And human,

844
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,640
Made it.

845
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,640
This also our team,

846
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,640
Made right inside wrapper,

847
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,640
Anyway,

848
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,640
Seojin, most

849
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,640
Likes received,

850
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,640
In actual automated AI workflows,

851
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,640
Where were points where

852
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,640
Human evaluation or intervention entered,

853
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,640
Humans still need to

854
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,640
Enter in middle,

855
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,640
When were moments judged,

856
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,640
Curious.

857
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,640
This question,

858
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,640
Exactly where,

859
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,640
Seojin is using,

860
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,640
Why judged so, curious.

861
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,640
That question,

862
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,640
Received most likes.

863
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,640
First previously,

864
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,640
I don't intervene,

865
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,640
Premise system,

866
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,640
Was attached.

867
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,640
But, anyway,

868
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,640
That system being good,

869
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,640
Diplomatically human,

870
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,640
Reviews,

871
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,640
First,

872
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,640
I lack

873
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,640
Domain knowledge.

874
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,640
In development process,

875
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,640
Not sure if that's the question,

876
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,640
Marketing variations,

877
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,640
Producing,

878
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,640
After executing marketing,

879
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,640
Why this variation had good results,

880
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,640
Why this variation,

881
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,640
Why didn't this campaign work well?

882
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,640
Like,

883
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,640
Extracting insights qualitatively,

884
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,640
Must be with domain experts,

885
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,640
Together,

886
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,640
Review results.

887
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,640
I lack domain knowledge,

888
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,640
Can't extract proper insights in parts,

889
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,640
First,

890
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,640
Must have humans enter,

891
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,640
Placed.

892
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,640
I actually mostly,

893
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,640
Don't look in middle.

894
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,640
Look at results,

895
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,640
Modify,

896
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,640
A bit more,

897
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,640
Will think about it.

898
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,640
Next also,

899
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,640
Most likes received,

900
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,640
Seojin's question.

901
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,640
Continuing, simply,

902
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,640
Until creating builder and marketer,

903
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,640
What learning process and,

904
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,640
References were there,

905
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,640
Trial and error question.

906
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,640
How could such sophisticated agent,

907
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,640
Be made.

908
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,640
This is a bit embarrassing,

909
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,640
Continuously,

910
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,640
Intentionally,

911
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,640
Must humans do this?

912
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,640
Repeat finding references,

913
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,640
Why must I do this?

914
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,640
From that perspective,

915
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,640
Repeating all work,

916
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,640
It became like that.

917
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,640
In that process,

918
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,640
Anyway,

919
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,640
Actually,

920
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,640
That workflow,

921
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,640
Like myself,

922
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,640
When working feels best.

923
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,640
When designed like that,

924
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,640
Results in middle,

925
00:34:06,639 --> 00:34:08,639
Why didn't it work well?

926
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,639
Why did this skill,

927
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,639
I told it to check this part,

928
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,639
Why did it pass the gate?

929
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,639
Doubts arise sometimes.

930
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,639
Now,

931
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,639
Must,

932
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,639
Skills in middle,

933
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,639
Make them tool-call,

934
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,639
Tool-call results and,

935
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,639
Function contents all logged,

936
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,639
LLM,

937
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,639
In batch at once,

938
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,639
Patterns I often said and,

939
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,639
Error patterns that often occurred,

940
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,639
Analyze and modify.

941
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,639
What's the reference,

942
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,639
Workflows I'm working on,

943
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,639
Observe,

944
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,639
Measure,

945
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,639
Enable improvement,

946
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,639
That's the biggest reference.

947
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,639
Observe, measure,

948
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:00,639
Improve.

949
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:02,639
I definitely heard somewhere.

950
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:04,639
Amazing.

951
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:06,639
So good.

952
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:08,639
Donghoon also has next question.

953
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:12,639
Practitioners,

954
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:14,639
Those who utilize AI well,

955
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:16,639
Selecting,

956
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:18,639
Direct problem-solving seems

957
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:20,639
Currently best,

958
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:22,639
In selecting practitioners,

959
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:24,639
Ultimately AI,

960
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:26,639
Personas who utilize well,

961
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:28,639
Selecting,

962
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:30,639
People who use AI well,

963
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:32,639
Selecting,

964
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:34,639
Or,

965
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:36,639
Earning rewards to encourage such things,

966
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:38,639
Continuing,

967
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:40,639
Additionally,

968
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:42,639
Technical support level supporting,

969
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:44,639
To what extent,

970
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:46,639
What form,

971
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:48,639
Curious about that.

972
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:50,639
Yes.

973
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:52,639
First,

974
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:54,639
Making such programs,

975
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:56,639
Structuring incentives well

976
00:35:56,639 --> 00:35:58,639
Is really important.

977
00:35:58,639 --> 00:36:00,639
But, those who use well,

978
00:36:00,639 --> 00:36:02,639
Even without running such programs,

979
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:04,639
Use well to create impact,

980
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:06,639
Gets well announced.

981
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:08,639
That's what I saw.

982
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:12,639
What we can prime,

983
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:14,639
First that incentive has,

984
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:16,639
Financial rewards too.

985
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:18,639
My monthly presentation,

986
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:20,639
Presenting about 500,000 won

987
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:22,639
Prize attached.

988
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:24,639
So, like this,

989
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:26,639
It's designed,

990
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:32,639
We,

991
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:34,639
Those who do well,

992
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:36,639
Of course must attract well,

993
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:40,639
Others too,

994
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:42,639
Somewhat, how to say,

995
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:44,639
We first,

996
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:46,639
Before starting recruitment,

997
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:48,639
Start recruiting.

998
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:50,639
When recruiting,

999
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:52,639
We made Google form.

1000
00:36:52,639 --> 00:36:54,639
Here really detailed,

1001
00:36:54,639 --> 00:36:56,639
Write.

1002
00:36:56,639 --> 00:36:58,639
But that Google detailed,

1003
00:36:58,639 --> 00:37:00,639
Too obvious they can't write themselves.

1004
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:04,639
Making this,

1005
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,639
Made one GPT.

1006
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:08,639
So this,

1007
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:10,639
Generally interviewers should have,

1008
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:12,639
Virtues or,

1009
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:14,639
Interviewer skills,

1010
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:16,639
Just extract once.

1011
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:18,639
Made as YAML,

1012
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:20,639
And, our questionnaires,

1013
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:22,639
Extract all,

1014
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:24,639
Said need to make this,

1015
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:26,639
Last instruction,

1016
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:28,639
If you finished questions,

1017
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:30,639
Got all answers,

1018
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:32,639
Make to recoverable level immediately.

1019
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:34,639
Did like this.

1020
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:36,639
Here, how well their workflow,

1021
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:38,639
Organized,

1022
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:40,639
What they want in mind,

1023
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:42,639
Is specified,

1024
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:44,639
And with this can sufficiently create business impact,

1025
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:46,639
Item,

1026
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:48,639
And they have to solve this,

1027
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:50,639
Will or time allocation,

1028
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:52,639
Have such things,

1029
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:54,639
Focused on looking at these.

1030
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:56,639
So like that,

1031
00:37:56,639 --> 00:37:58,639
Ultimately we did qualitative evaluation.

1032
00:37:58,639 --> 00:38:00,639
Did that,

1033
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:02,639
How we help,

1034
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:04,639
Now we,

1035
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:06,639
Have 3 team members,

1036
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:08,639
15 projects 5 each handling,

1037
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:10,639
Mentoring.

1038
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:14,639
Office hours 2 hours,

1039
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:16,639
About 3 people waiting for me.

1040
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:18,639
Then I now,

1041
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:20,639
30 minutes each,

1042
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:22,639
Work.

1043
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:24,639
This,

1044
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:26,639
Technical some,

1045
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:28,639
What to use to solve this problem.

1046
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,639
n8n, Google Apps Script,

1047
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:32,639
Or with Cursor,

1048
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:34,639
Web service development, with Supabase there,

1049
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:36,639
Many recipes, these things,

1050
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:38,639
All made in pre-interview stage.

1051
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:40,639
Almost pre-interview,

1052
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:42,639
Human interview once more.

1053
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:44,639
So now really,

1054
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:46,639
What pictures to draw,

1055
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:48,639
Actually must align with person,

1056
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:50,639
Do that interview once more,

1057
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:52,639
There technically,

1058
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:54,639
What tools to use to make,

1059
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:56,639
That combination we,

1060
00:38:56,639 --> 00:38:58,639
First primarily making.

1061
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:00,639
But actually building up,

1062
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:02,639
Something,

1063
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:04,639
Change factors are many.

1064
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:06,639
So, those things,

1065
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:08,639
How do we do then,

1066
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:10,639
Use n8n,

1067
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:12,639
Actually don't know well.

1068
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:14,639
All first-time users,

1069
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:16,639
We were first too.

1070
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:18,639
Then, from Google Spreadsheet extract data,

1071
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:20,639
Give AI some prompt input,

1072
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:22,639
Resulting insight tools,

1073
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:24,639
Feed back to Google Spreadsheet,

1074
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:28,639
Here somehow templating,

1075
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:30,639
Make some slides in Google Slides,

1076
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:32,639
Take that link,

1077
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:34,639
Send email from Google Spreadsheet.

1078
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:36,639
All this can be done with n8n.

1079
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:38,639
Then we, my method is,

1080
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:40,639
Slightly different per team member,

1081
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:42,639
I can get Google Spreadsheet data with n8n.

1082
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:44,639
Show sample.

1083
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:48,639
Put some data in AI,

1084
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:50,639
Can extract some output.

1085
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:52,639
Show this once,

1086
00:39:52,639 --> 00:39:54,639
And can put this data in Google Spreadsheet.

1087
00:39:54,639 --> 00:39:56,639
Show this,

1088
00:39:56,639 --> 00:39:58,639
Can send email. Show,

1089
00:39:58,639 --> 00:40:00,639
With what template in Google Slides,

1090
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:02,639
Can produce one slide.

1091
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:04,639
Give those elements,

1092
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:06,639
Now Lego blocks all prepared,

1093
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:08,639
Assemble,

1094
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:10,639
What hyperparameters to put there,

1095
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:12,639
You,

1096
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:14,639
Test.

1097
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:16,639
Doing like this.

1098
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:18,639
Good.

1099
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:22,639
Now I'm not asking

1100
00:40:22,639 --> 00:40:24,639
In like order,

1101
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:26,639
There's an interesting question,

1102
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:28,639
So asking,

1103
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:30,639
AX and,

1104
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:32,639
Startups seem really similar.

1105
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:34,639
In that sense,

1106
00:40:34,639 --> 00:40:36,639
Becoming AX is difficult,

1107
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:38,639
But business is very clear,

1108
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:40,639
If there's a company,

1109
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:42,639
Rather than fixing it,

1110
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:46,639
How about remaking with AI?

1111
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:50,639
Not fixing,

1112
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:52,639
Looking and making new.

1113
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:54,639
About this,

1114
00:40:54,639 --> 00:40:56,639
Curious about panelists' opinions.

1115
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:00,639
That,

1116
00:41:00,639 --> 00:41:02,639
There's a client,

1117
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:04,639
Doesn't seem AI native,

1118
00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:06,639
When AI native grows bigger,

1119
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:08,639
Rather than changing, isn't it better I start a company,

1120
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:10,639
Seems like this question.

1121
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:12,639
Hear daily.

1122
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:14,639
Startup is startup,

1123
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:16,639
Fixing and,

1124
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:18,639
Looking and making new,

1125
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:20,639
Which is better,

1126
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:22,639
What do you think about this?

1127
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:24,639
Definitely,

1128
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:26,639
tear it down and build new,

1129
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:28,639
that's definitely better.

1130
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:34,639
When I thought about this too,

1131
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:36,639
if this is harder than starting a business,

1132
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:38,639
then starting a business is better, right?

1133
00:41:40,639 --> 00:41:42,639
As an individual in this era,

1134
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:44,639
ways to make a lot of money are,

1135
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:46,639
though this is a difficult business,

1136
00:41:46,639 --> 00:41:48,639
accomplishing this to capture

1137
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:50,639
more money.

1138
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:52,639
Or,

1139
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:54,639
thinking this feels like a legacy business,

1140
00:41:54,639 --> 00:41:56,639
just do it myself then.

1141
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:58,639
I'll start a business,

1142
00:41:58,639 --> 00:42:00,639
self-supply,

1143
00:42:00,639 --> 00:42:02,639
if there's a vendor like this,

1144
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:04,639
it really feels like a legacy here.

1145
00:42:04,639 --> 00:42:06,639
A business supplying desks and equipment

1146
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:08,639
to companies,

1147
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:10,639
here just,

1148
00:42:10,639 --> 00:42:12,639
100 people,

1149
00:42:12,639 --> 00:42:14,639
if these are typically small-medium businesses,

1150
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:16,639
reducing labor costs drastically to 5 people,

1151
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:18,639
if you just widen the price gap,

1152
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:20,639
ultimately to customers,

1153
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:22,639
the service they see is the same,

1154
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:24,639
but since the price is much cheaper,

1155
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:26,639
could we break in?

1156
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:28,639
That's what you might think,

1157
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:30,639
but I think this is quite dangerous.

1158
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:32,639
I think so too.

1159
00:42:32,639 --> 00:42:34,639
Me too,

1160
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:36,639
trying to expand the business in various ways,

1161
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:38,639
while trying new markets,

1162
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:40,639
I've tried for a long time,

1163
00:42:40,639 --> 00:42:42,639
what looks like legacy in a certain market,

1164
00:42:42,639 --> 00:42:44,639
mid-sized and small companies each holding their position,

1165
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:46,639
they all have reasons.

1166
00:42:46,639 --> 00:42:48,639
So, it's not just about price,

1167
00:42:48,639 --> 00:42:50,639
that's not it. That customers choose them.

1168
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:52,639
So, things I don't know,

1169
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:54,639
they each hold some edge I don't know about,

1170
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:56,639
these people have been running businesses

1171
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:58,639
sustainably for 10, 20 years,

1172
00:42:58,639 --> 00:43:00,639
so these are organizations that have,

1173
00:43:00,639 --> 00:43:02,639
simply from AX,

1174
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:04,639
being cheaper, being fancier,

1175
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:06,639
even now,

1176
00:43:06,639 --> 00:43:08,639
can't even raise output quality,

1177
00:43:08,639 --> 00:43:10,639
the businesses you've seen ultimately,

1178
00:43:10,639 --> 00:43:12,639
even with AX, the value delivered to customers is the same,

1179
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:14,639
so there's only price value,

1180
00:43:14,639 --> 00:43:16,639
with just price value,

1181
00:43:16,639 --> 00:43:18,639
can you penetrate the market?

1182
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:20,639
Well, you have to try to know,

1183
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:22,639
picking one of those,

1184
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:24,639
breaking through well,

1185
00:43:24,639 --> 00:43:26,639
succeeding that way,

1186
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:28,639
you could bet on that,

1187
00:41:28,639 --> 00:43:30,639
I think the failure probability is quite high.

1188
00:43:32,639 --> 00:43:34,639
While trying AX in various businesses,

1189
00:43:34,639 --> 00:43:36,639
oh, here AX itself can really

1190
00:43:36,639 --> 00:43:38,639
work as an edge,

1191
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:40,639
when you get that feeling about a business,

1192
00:43:40,639 --> 00:43:42,639
grabbing a specific vertical,

1193
00:43:42,639 --> 00:43:44,639
that's when you start a business,

1194
00:43:44,639 --> 00:43:46,639
I think that might be a safer play.

1195
00:43:48,639 --> 00:43:50,639
That's great.

1196
00:43:52,639 --> 00:43:54,639
I can't not hear from Seojin.

1197
00:43:54,639 --> 00:43:56,639
Because Seojin grabbed a vertical,

1198
00:43:56,639 --> 00:43:58,639
and is doing it now.

1199
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:04,639
Are you tearing down and building new?

1200
00:44:04,639 --> 00:44:06,639
I had nothing to tear down first.

1201
00:44:06,639 --> 00:44:08,639
When I was at a company before,

1202
00:44:08,639 --> 00:44:10,639
I wanted to tear it down but couldn't.

1203
00:44:10,639 --> 00:44:12,639
If you tear it down, you get in trouble.

1204
00:44:12,639 --> 00:44:14,639
So I'm building new.

1205
00:44:16,639 --> 00:44:18,639
So now,

1206
00:44:18,639 --> 00:44:20,639
you're doing AX for brands'

1207
00:44:20,639 --> 00:44:22,639
businesses,

1208
00:44:22,639 --> 00:44:24,639
that's what you started, right?

1209
00:44:26,639 --> 00:44:28,639
When starting,

1210
00:44:30,639 --> 00:44:32,639
working with a brand,

1211
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:34,639
respecting their workflow,

1212
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:36,639
VS,

1213
00:44:36,639 --> 00:44:38,639
tear it down and build new.

1214
00:44:38,639 --> 00:44:40,639
Definitely tear it down.

1215
00:44:40,639 --> 00:44:42,639
Definitely tear it down.

1216
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:44,639
Definitely tear it down,

1217
00:44:44,639 --> 00:44:46,639
if you try to use the former somehow,

1218
00:44:46,639 --> 00:44:48,639
it's so frustrating,

1219
00:44:48,639 --> 00:44:50,639
growth doesn't happen.

1220
00:44:50,639 --> 00:44:52,639
It's easy.

1221
00:44:52,639 --> 00:44:54,639
But what's really difficult is,

1222
00:44:54,639 --> 00:44:56,639
people using the original workflow,

1223
00:44:56,639 --> 00:44:58,639
they want to stick to it.

1224
00:44:58,639 --> 00:45:00,639
They want to keep their ways.

1225
00:45:02,639 --> 00:45:04,639
Getting them hooked on the show,

1226
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:06,639
seems important.

1227
00:45:06,639 --> 00:45:08,639
Anyway, for me,

1228
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:10,639
the conclusion is we need to tear it down,

1229
00:45:10,639 --> 00:45:12,639
that's the biggest concern,

1230
00:45:12,639 --> 00:45:14,639
and my conclusion is show them first.

1231
00:45:18,639 --> 00:45:20,639
Show them while tearing down.

1232
00:45:20,639 --> 00:45:22,639
I see.

1233
00:45:22,639 --> 00:45:24,639
I have so many questions here,

1234
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:26,639
it's a bit difficult

1235
00:45:26,639 --> 00:45:28,639
to go through all of them.

1236
00:45:28,639 --> 00:45:30,639
So to capture the feeling

1237
00:45:30,639 --> 00:45:32,639
of meeting offline,

1238
00:45:32,639 --> 00:45:34,639
from now on,

1239
00:45:34,639 --> 00:45:36,639
I'd like to take questions directly.

1240
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:38,639
Whether you wrote questions here

1241
00:45:38,639 --> 00:45:40,639
or not, it doesn't matter.

1242
00:45:40,639 --> 00:45:42,639
Raise your hand now,

1243
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:44,639
if you have a question,

1244
00:45:44,639 --> 00:45:46,639
I'll come to you.

1245
00:45:46,639 --> 00:45:48,639
I'll bring the mic.

1246
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:52,639
Hello.

1247
00:45:52,639 --> 00:45:54,639
I'm Park Jonghyun.

1248
00:45:54,639 --> 00:45:56,639
Following up on the previous question,

1249
00:45:56,639 --> 00:45:58,639
I had a question.

1250
00:46:00,639 --> 00:46:02,639
People,

1251
00:46:02,639 --> 00:46:04,639
are hard to change.

1252
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:08,639
I think tearing down is right.

1253
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:10,639
I spent a year trying to change people,

1254
00:46:10,639 --> 00:46:12,639
pushing AX hard,

1255
00:46:12,639 --> 00:46:14,639
and saw it not working too many times.

1256
00:46:14,639 --> 00:46:16,639
So like you said earlier,

1257
00:46:16,639 --> 00:46:18,639
you have to change the people.

1258
00:46:18,639 --> 00:46:20,639
Remove all the people,

1259
00:46:20,639 --> 00:46:22,639
and create new people.

1260
00:46:24,639 --> 00:46:26,639
I've reached this conclusion.

1261
00:46:26,639 --> 00:46:28,639
But ultimately,

1262
00:46:28,639 --> 00:46:30,639
that's tearing down and building new.

1263
00:46:30,639 --> 00:46:32,639
So that kind of,

1264
00:46:32,639 --> 00:46:34,639
is my current conclusion.

1265
00:46:34,639 --> 00:46:36,639
Big companies,

1266
00:46:36,639 --> 00:46:38,639
might have the will,

1267
00:46:38,639 --> 00:46:40,639
but will face many challenges,

1268
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:42,639
and companies without that will,

1269
00:46:42,639 --> 00:46:44,639
like Seojin, whom I heard about today for the first time,

1270
00:46:44,639 --> 00:46:46,639
running a service alone like that,

1271
00:46:46,639 --> 00:46:48,639
will inevitably

1272
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:50,639
lose to services like that.

1273
00:46:50,639 --> 00:46:52,639
Eventually.

1274
00:46:52,639 --> 00:46:54,639
Big companies will face challenges.

1275
00:46:54,639 --> 00:46:56,639
That's what I think,

1276
00:46:56,639 --> 00:46:58,639
and extending this thought,

1277
00:46:58,639 --> 00:47:00,639
organizations as we know them now,

1278
00:47:00,639 --> 00:47:02,639
have enormous power,

1279
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:04,639
and people gather,

1280
00:47:04,639 --> 00:47:06,639
big synergy?

1281
00:47:06,639 --> 00:47:08,639
Creating big value,

1282
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:10,639
but you're making it alone, right?

1283
00:47:10,639 --> 00:47:12,639
Organizations,

1284
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:14,639
will organizations of the future,

1285
00:47:14,639 --> 00:47:16,639
be able to exist?

1286
00:47:16,639 --> 00:47:18,639
Many organizations will disappear,

1287
00:47:18,639 --> 00:47:20,639
so how will future organizations look,

1288
00:47:20,639 --> 00:47:22,639
I'm curious.

1289
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:24,639
Let me take the lead,

1290
00:47:24,639 --> 00:47:26,639
and think about it,

1291
00:47:26,639 --> 00:47:28,639
I've been continuously,

1292
00:47:28,639 --> 00:47:30,639
increasing our business unit's productivity.

1293
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:32,639
With the keyword AX,

1294
00:47:32,639 --> 00:47:34,639
since the CEO isn't curious about it,

1295
00:47:34,639 --> 00:47:36,639
anyway,

1296
00:47:36,639 --> 00:47:38,639
proposing more,

1297
00:47:38,639 --> 00:47:40,639
winning more,

1298
00:47:40,639 --> 00:47:42,639
did it make money,

1299
00:47:42,639 --> 00:47:44,639
from that perspective,

1300
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:46,639
I think organizations,

1301
00:47:46,639 --> 00:47:48,639
why do they survive?

1302
00:47:50,639 --> 00:47:52,639
Why do organizations

1303
00:47:52,639 --> 00:47:54,639
seem to survive,

1304
00:47:56,639 --> 00:47:58,639
I think the source of truth

1305
00:47:58,639 --> 00:48:00,639
isn't properly built yet, so organizations

1306
00:48:00,639 --> 00:48:02,639
will inevitably survive.

1307
00:48:02,639 --> 00:48:04,639
For example, we have

1308
00:48:04,639 --> 00:48:06,639
a sales SaaS,

1309
00:48:06,639 --> 00:48:08,639
and Slack, and Google Spreadsheets

1310
00:48:08,639 --> 00:48:10,639
with planning documents,

1311
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:12,639
and proposals in PPT.

1312
00:48:14,639 --> 00:48:16,639
AI can do everything humans can do,

1313
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:18,639
all of it,

1314
00:48:18,639 --> 00:48:20,639
but needs to receive all the context I have,

1315
00:48:20,639 --> 00:48:22,639
that's what needs to be given,

1316
00:48:22,639 --> 00:48:24,639
so what we're doing now is,

1317
00:48:24,639 --> 00:48:26,639
creating a source of truth,

1318
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:28,639
so it can all be fed to the AI,

1319
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:30,639
making it,

1320
00:48:30,639 --> 00:48:32,639
but that's not easy.

1321
00:48:32,639 --> 00:48:34,639
AI can't remember all context at once,

1322
00:48:34,639 --> 00:48:36,639
memorizing human people,

1323
00:48:36,639 --> 00:48:38,639
to use only when needed at once,

1324
00:48:38,639 --> 00:48:40,639
not yet possible,

1325
00:48:40,639 --> 00:48:42,639
so when needed, the information needed

1326
00:48:42,639 --> 00:48:44,639
has to be accessed,

1327
00:48:44,639 --> 00:48:46,639
making something like that,

1328
00:48:46,639 --> 00:48:48,639
until that's ready,

1329
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:50,639
people will keep gathering

1330
00:48:50,639 --> 00:48:52,639
scattered data sources,

1331
00:48:52,639 --> 00:48:54,639
in their heads to consolidate,

1332
00:48:54,639 --> 00:48:56,639
they have to keep doing that,

1333
00:48:56,639 --> 00:48:58,639
for the proposal due today

1334
00:48:58,639 --> 00:49:00,639
to go out today, and tomorrow too.

1335
00:49:00,639 --> 00:49:02,639
So DT has to happen first,

1336
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:04,639
that's what I think,

1337
00:49:06,639 --> 00:49:08,639
until it's complete,

1338
00:49:08,639 --> 00:49:10,639
people are somewhat needed,

1339
00:49:10,639 --> 00:49:12,639
honestly, I think that's their lifespan.

1340
00:49:18,639 --> 00:49:20,639
I thought exactly the same as Jonghyun.

1341
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:22,639
Thinking the same,

1342
00:49:22,639 --> 00:49:24,639
Seojin is the future,

1343
00:49:24,639 --> 00:49:26,639
that's it,

1344
00:49:26,639 --> 00:49:28,639
I thought,

1345
00:49:28,639 --> 00:49:30,639
but what's really interesting is,

1346
00:49:30,639 --> 00:49:32,639
with Seojin at the center,

1347
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:34,639
people gather around,

1348
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:36,639
or a better organization

1349
00:49:36,639 --> 00:49:38,639
will seek out Seojin,

1350
00:49:38,639 --> 00:49:40,639
ultimately something that looks like an organization,

1351
00:49:40,639 --> 00:49:42,639
in the past it might not have been called

1352
00:49:42,639 --> 00:49:44,639
an organization.

1353
00:49:44,639 --> 00:49:46,639
Things that look like organizations,

1354
00:49:46,639 --> 00:49:48,639
will form.

1355
00:49:48,639 --> 00:49:50,639
And then I,

1356
00:49:50,639 --> 00:49:52,639
Cursor recently,

1357
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:54,639
when they got funding,

1358
00:49:54,639 --> 00:49:56,639
did a lot of branding about

1359
00:49:56,639 --> 00:49:58,639
how they work.

1360
00:49:58,639 --> 00:50:00,639
On X,

1361
00:50:00,639 --> 00:50:02,639
if you search "First day at Cursor",

1362
00:50:02,639 --> 00:50:04,639
with that phrase,

1363
00:50:04,639 --> 00:50:06,639
there are lots of photos

1364
00:50:06,639 --> 00:50:08,639
that come up,

1365
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:10,639
photos of shoes scattered around,

1366
00:50:10,639 --> 00:50:12,639
US startups,

1367
00:50:12,639 --> 00:50:14,639
among US and other startups,

1368
00:50:14,639 --> 00:50:16,639
there are startups with a culture

1369
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:18,639
of taking off shoes before entering.

1370
00:50:18,639 --> 00:50:20,639
Cursor is very representative of that.

1371
00:50:20,639 --> 00:50:22,639
So they,

1372
00:50:22,639 --> 00:50:24,639
even now,

1373
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:26,639
how do they work,

1374
00:50:26,639 --> 00:50:28,639
not that different.

1375
00:50:28,639 --> 00:50:30,639
They work quite analog.

1376
00:50:30,639 --> 00:50:32,639
What I imagined was,

1377
00:50:32,639 --> 00:50:34,639
wouldn't Cursor use Agents most easily?

1378
00:50:34,639 --> 00:50:36,639
Then each person,

1379
00:50:36,639 --> 00:50:38,639
sitting at their desk,

1380
00:50:38,639 --> 00:50:40,639
working from home,

1381
00:50:40,639 --> 00:50:42,639
and the rest should work,

1382
00:50:42,639 --> 00:50:44,639
they'd get lots of funding too.

1383
00:50:44,639 --> 00:50:46,639
Running Agents like crazy,

1384
00:41:46,639 --> 00:50:48,639
working that way, I thought,

1385
00:50:48,639 --> 00:50:50,639
new feature is out.

1386
00:50:50,639 --> 00:50:52,639
Then everyone come to the basement.

1387
00:50:52,639 --> 00:50:54,639
So they go to the basement,

1388
00:50:54,639 --> 00:50:56,639
to the basement,

1389
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:58,639
to find bugs in the new feature,

1390
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:00,639
they break it. The developers.

1391
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:04,639
Among startups,

1392
00:51:04,639 --> 00:51:06,639
one of the places where the smartest people

1393
00:51:06,639 --> 00:51:08,639
in the world have gathered

1394
00:51:08,639 --> 00:51:10,639
is probably there,

1395
00:51:10,639 --> 00:51:12,639
and even there,

1396
00:51:12,639 --> 00:51:14,639
they work like a traditional organization,

1397
00:51:14,639 --> 00:51:16,639
I see.

1398
00:51:16,639 --> 00:51:18,639
So the form might

1399
00:51:18,639 --> 00:51:20,639
change,

1400
00:51:20,639 --> 00:51:22,639
but people gather

1401
00:51:22,639 --> 00:51:24,639
to work together.

1402
00:51:24,639 --> 00:51:26,639
That was so interesting.

1403
00:51:26,639 --> 00:51:28,639
So hearing Jonghyun's story,

1404
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:30,639
actually even before that,

1405
00:51:30,639 --> 00:51:32,639
I thought very similarly,

1406
00:51:32,639 --> 00:51:34,639
and wanting to learn,

1407
00:51:34,639 --> 00:51:36,639
I contacted Seojin,

1408
00:51:36,639 --> 00:51:38,639
and wanting to learn,

1409
00:51:38,639 --> 00:51:40,639
with other people,

1410
00:41:40,639 --> 00:51:42,639
doing things together,

1411
00:51:42,639 --> 00:51:44,639
really in an offline space,

1412
00:51:44,639 --> 00:51:46,639
gathering to do something.

1413
00:51:46,639 --> 00:51:48,639
That,

1414
00:51:48,639 --> 00:51:50,639
I think is really valuable.

1415
00:51:50,639 --> 00:51:52,639
I think so.

1416
00:51:52,639 --> 00:51:54,639
The definition of organization may change,

1417
00:51:54,639 --> 00:51:56,639
I don't know.

1418
00:51:56,639 --> 00:51:58,639
Offline,

1419
00:51:58,639 --> 00:52:00,639
I think organizations,

1420
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:02,639
when people gather offline together,

1421
00:52:02,639 --> 00:52:04,639
that's an organization,

1422
00:52:04,639 --> 00:52:06,639
I actually,

1423
00:52:06,639 --> 00:52:08,639
I'm curious about Jonghyun's opinion.

1424
00:52:08,639 --> 00:52:10,639
At MyRealTrip,

1425
00:52:10,639 --> 00:52:12,639
from now on,

1426
00:52:12,639 --> 00:52:14,639
opening a camp,

1427
00:52:14,639 --> 00:52:16,639
gradually releasing the intent,

1428
00:52:16,639 --> 00:52:18,639
you made that decision.

1429
00:52:18,639 --> 00:52:20,639
Having made that decision,

1430
00:52:20,639 --> 00:52:22,639
how it differs from the existing organization,

1431
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:24,639
I was curious.

1432
00:52:24,639 --> 00:52:26,639
I was curious about that.

1433
00:52:20,673 --> 00:52:25,673
I'm curious how the structure changes.

1434
00:52:26,173 --> 00:52:30,673
As you might have expected, they're quite confused.

1435
00:52:33,373 --> 00:52:37,173
And so it seems like many are leaving.

1436
00:52:40,373 --> 00:52:42,573
Actually, that's how I felt.

1437
00:52:43,173 --> 00:52:44,173
Tearing down and rebuilding.

1438
00:52:46,773 --> 00:52:54,073
I think all our members agree that we need to adapt to change.

1439
00:52:54,873 --> 00:52:56,873
I don't think they're resisting this.

1440
00:52:57,373 --> 00:53:01,073
But I think they're struggling because they don't know how,

1441
00:53:01,473 --> 00:53:06,573
and thinking that the company should present this to them?

1442
00:53:06,673 --> 00:53:08,673
I kind of thought that too.

1443
00:53:09,173 --> 00:53:12,073
But actually right now,

1444
00:53:12,373 --> 00:53:15,373
well, how has the world changed?

1445
00:53:15,973 --> 00:53:21,373
Changes of a week, month or two are happening continuously now,

1446
00:53:21,773 --> 00:53:23,373
that's a bit hard to expect.

1447
00:53:23,573 --> 00:53:26,573
But what should I say?

1448
00:53:27,973 --> 00:53:33,073
One proposition I'm thinking about is,

1449
00:53:34,373 --> 00:53:38,173
when people work with people,

1450
00:53:38,573 --> 00:53:48,173
if there's a dependency, productivity drops by 10x, I think.

1451
00:53:48,473 --> 00:53:52,873
That's the productivity difference I felt between the Echo Delta project

1452
00:53:53,073 --> 00:53:56,673
and when solving my own problems by myself.

1453
00:53:57,473 --> 00:54:01,773
Because it's so clear, right?

1454
00:54:04,273 --> 00:54:05,273
I'll go develop this.

1455
00:54:05,373 --> 00:54:06,473
Please do this.

1456
00:54:06,573 --> 00:54:07,273
I'll develop it.

1457
00:54:07,273 --> 00:54:07,973
By when?

1458
00:54:08,073 --> 00:54:09,073
By next Monday.

1459
00:54:09,273 --> 00:54:11,473
When it comes, of course you won't like it.

1460
00:54:11,673 --> 00:54:13,873
Then you explain that in words again,

1461
00:54:14,073 --> 00:54:16,273
they receive that feedback and bring it back in a few days,

1462
00:54:16,473 --> 00:54:17,673
then you won't like it again.

1463
00:54:18,173 --> 00:54:22,273
Continuously organizing these in your head and speaking them out,

1464
00:54:22,373 --> 00:54:26,273
and then understanding that with completely leaked data,

1465
00:54:26,373 --> 00:54:31,373
and after a few days with whatever wrong information

1466
00:54:31,673 --> 00:54:36,173
mixed in together,

1467
00:54:37,173 --> 00:54:39,973
comes out as some implementation,

1468
00:54:40,073 --> 00:54:42,873
but actually just thinking in your head,

1469
00:54:42,973 --> 00:54:45,973
giving feedback when thoughts come up right away,

1470
00:54:46,073 --> 00:54:48,673
and then getting results back in 1 minute, right?

1471
00:54:49,173 --> 00:54:52,373
I think things will go more that way.

1472
00:54:52,473 --> 00:54:55,773
Of course, and everyone knows,

1473
00:54:55,873 --> 00:55:00,673
like Seojin, 1-person companies will keep emerging, not necessarily in big markets,

1474
00:55:00,673 --> 00:55:03,673
such companies will keep appearing,

1475
00:55:03,773 --> 00:55:07,773
from an entrepreneur's perspective, the pressure must be immense.

1476
00:55:07,873 --> 00:55:11,373
So attempts to keep downsizing organizations will continue,

1477
00:55:11,473 --> 00:55:15,373
and how far will it shrink is a bit of a concern, a thought,

1478
00:55:15,473 --> 00:55:16,973
I do have that concern.

1479
00:55:17,373 --> 00:55:21,373
But I worked as a 1-person team for a very long time.

1480
00:55:21,673 --> 00:55:23,873
Then I hired one intern,

1481
00:55:24,373 --> 00:55:27,473
and at that time, the perception that the team was running well,

1482
00:55:28,173 --> 00:55:29,873
leadership had that perception.

1483
00:55:30,173 --> 00:55:33,973
And the moment that person left, it felt like the team stopped,

1484
00:55:34,473 --> 00:55:35,473
they said they felt that.

1485
00:55:35,773 --> 00:55:36,773
And it actually was a bit like that.

1486
00:55:36,873 --> 00:55:42,073
Some programs like case sharing sessions were put on hold,

1487
00:55:42,673 --> 00:55:43,473
things like that.

1488
00:55:43,773 --> 00:55:47,273
Looking at this, in a way,

1489
00:55:47,373 --> 00:55:51,973
while there are issues from not delegating enough to AI,

1490
00:55:52,373 --> 00:55:56,173
I heard in some podcast before,

1491
00:55:56,373 --> 00:55:58,773
what can humans do, when asked that,

1492
00:55:59,073 --> 00:56:00,873
having a will and manifesting it,

1493
00:56:01,073 --> 00:56:05,073
I think I heard something like that.

1494
00:56:05,673 --> 00:56:09,373
The difference between having that point at one, two,

1495
00:56:09,673 --> 00:56:11,473
and three, there seems to be a difference.

1496
00:56:11,873 --> 00:56:14,973
Each person with their own will,

1497
00:56:15,273 --> 00:56:18,473
with their own thoughts, using AI or not,

1498
00:56:19,373 --> 00:56:21,073
giving each other feedback,

1499
00:56:21,273 --> 00:56:24,973
the creative things that can emerge from there,

1500
00:56:25,073 --> 00:56:27,273
there definitely seems to be synergy.

1501
00:56:27,673 --> 00:56:32,373
For me, right now it's a 3-person team.

1502
00:56:32,473 --> 00:56:34,673
This is the biggest team now.

1503
00:56:35,573 --> 00:56:43,973
3 people, 3 feels to me like this might be the limit, I thought.

1504
00:56:46,073 --> 00:56:46,773
Very good.

1505
00:56:47,373 --> 00:56:52,273
If anyone has more questions, let me ask first.

1506
00:56:55,673 --> 00:56:56,573
Thank you for the great comments.

1507
00:56:56,973 --> 00:57:00,673
I'm Baek Yunho, running a company called SquareLight.

1508
00:57:02,273 --> 00:57:07,273
I use Claude, GPT, Gemini CLI, and Codex,

1509
00:57:08,273 --> 00:57:11,773
usually Claude Code, and if it doesn't work, I call Codex.

1510
00:57:12,573 --> 00:57:16,473
If Codex doesn't work, I try Gemini,

1511
00:57:17,473 --> 00:57:19,673
and if that doesn't work, I go back to Claude Code.

1512
00:57:20,173 --> 00:57:23,673
If the context gets too big, I make sub-agents too,

1513
00:57:24,173 --> 00:57:25,073
and try using skills,

1514
00:57:25,873 --> 00:57:29,173
for dependent ones, I use MCP Context 7 or similar,

1515
00:57:30,073 --> 00:57:32,773
but while juggling all this, eventually,

1516
00:57:33,273 --> 00:57:35,373
I also try Ultra Think as a last resort,

1517
00:57:35,773 --> 00:57:37,873
then that day just comes to a halt.

1518
00:57:38,773 --> 00:57:45,073
But when it ultimately doesn't get fixed, I'm really curious how all the speakers handle it.

1519
00:57:46,773 --> 00:57:50,473
Still, when it ultimately doesn't get fixed, the project size gets too big too,

1520
00:57:50,773 --> 00:57:54,173
like you mentioned, even making module-sized

1521
00:57:54,673 --> 00:57:56,773
separate Claude Code instances,

1522
00:57:57,373 --> 00:57:58,573
eventually as it grows,

1523
00:57:59,273 --> 00:58:04,173
sometimes there's no answer within these 3 models.

1524
00:58:04,273 --> 00:58:08,073
Of course, now we hire people with human intelligence to dig through,

1525
00:58:08,473 --> 00:58:10,073
between development gaps, we look,

1526
00:58:11,073 --> 00:58:14,873
but really, from the perspective of wanting to build an AI-native organization,

1527
00:58:15,573 --> 00:58:19,073
when stuck after juggling all 3,

1528
00:58:19,973 --> 00:58:21,573
if there are tips that broke through, please share.

1529
00:58:28,973 --> 00:58:29,973
The one you use most.

1530
00:58:32,973 --> 00:58:37,873
For now, I definitely have to look at it myself to solve it.

1531
00:58:44,773 --> 00:58:47,573
I've only tried up to 8 million lines, so I wouldn't know.

1532
00:58:49,673 --> 00:58:56,873
Actually, the project I'm running now isn't that big in size.

1533
00:58:57,173 --> 00:58:59,073
So there's no context issues to the point

1534
00:58:59,373 --> 00:59:01,973
where analysis itself gets stuck,

1535
00:59:02,473 --> 00:59:07,573
but what I focus on when building skills or sub-agents,

1536
00:59:07,873 --> 00:59:11,973
the main focus is testing.

1537
00:59:12,773 --> 00:59:16,573
So you mentioned thinking result-oriented,

1538
00:59:17,273 --> 00:59:19,573
but that test isn't unit testing.

1539
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:21,673
I'm not really curious about unit tests.

1540
00:59:23,573 --> 00:59:25,273
End-to-end testing is a must,

1541
00:59:25,373 --> 00:59:30,973
and those stages need to solidly build up step by step,

1542
00:59:31,073 --> 00:59:35,773
if you write hundreds of thousands of lines and then test,

1543
00:59:36,073 --> 00:59:41,273
mistakes from the first step snowball,

1544
00:59:41,273 --> 00:59:48,073
or you have to roll back to zero or 0.1 base again,

1545
00:59:48,473 --> 00:59:52,673
so I try to pack end-to-end tests as tightly as possible.

1546
00:59:52,773 --> 00:59:58,573
So when making agents or skills that create technical specs,

1547
00:59:58,873 --> 01:00:01,773
break it into the most granular specs you can.

1548
01:00:02,473 --> 01:00:04,073
That's the approach I take,

1549
01:00:04,173 --> 01:00:08,473
and for testing, I prefer end-to-end testing,

1550
01:00:08,473 --> 01:00:13,973
and if full-stack frontend and backend development is needed,

1551
01:00:14,273 --> 01:00:20,173
then frontend uses Playwright, backend uses curl-based

1552
01:00:20,473 --> 01:00:26,773
bash script verification, things like that.

1553
01:00:31,273 --> 01:00:34,173
This is a story about engineering.

1554
01:00:35,173 --> 01:00:42,673
I believe all frontier models will soon code better than me.

1555
01:00:43,173 --> 01:00:44,673
They definitely code better than me.

1556
01:00:45,173 --> 01:00:52,673
Then problems they can't solve, I'm unlikely to solve by looking at them.

1557
01:00:53,173 --> 01:00:55,673
Then what's the problem?

1558
01:00:56,173 --> 01:01:01,673
They're smarter than me, so there's no chance I can solve it by looking, I think.

1559
01:01:01,673 --> 01:01:05,673
If I'm unlikely to solve it by looking, the only variable I can give is context,

1560
01:01:06,173 --> 01:01:08,673
the only thing I can give is context,

1561
01:01:09,173 --> 01:01:13,673
so I approach it as how to manage this well.

1562
01:01:15,173 --> 01:01:20,673
Most problems within the coding framework humans have created,

1563
01:01:21,173 --> 01:01:27,673
Claude models usually have 200k context windows,

1564
01:01:27,673 --> 01:01:33,673
so problems too big to fit in there are rare, I think.

1565
01:01:34,173 --> 01:01:37,673
Such cases exist and are solvable problems,

1566
01:01:38,173 --> 01:01:42,673
if the problem fits within 100k, you need to manage context well,

1567
01:01:43,673 --> 01:01:49,673
when it fails once, saying "hey solve this again, try that way" in multi-turn,

1568
01:01:50,173 --> 01:01:52,173
bad context keeps accumulating.

1569
01:01:52,673 --> 01:01:56,673
And everyone knows performance degrades as context lengthens,

1570
01:01:56,673 --> 01:02:02,673
so what methodology I use is,

1571
01:02:03,173 --> 01:02:07,673
when it fails once, I just have it write a failure report.

1572
01:02:08,173 --> 01:02:12,173
Write a failure report, save that report as a file,

1573
01:02:12,673 --> 01:02:20,673
open a new session, with the prompt I gave before to solve the issue,

1574
01:02:21,173 --> 01:02:25,673
and "I failed with this before, here's the failure report",

1575
01:02:25,673 --> 01:02:31,673
these two contexts compressed, I have it try solving the problem again.

1576
01:02:32,173 --> 01:02:35,673
Then it tries without at least that one trial-and-error,

1577
01:02:36,173 --> 01:02:40,673
so probability of solving increases slightly, I think.

1578
01:02:41,173 --> 01:02:43,673
Using multiple models is also a great method,

1579
01:02:44,173 --> 01:02:48,673
but managing context well like this is also a good method, I think.

1580
01:02:49,673 --> 01:02:53,673
And one more thing I wanted to mention,

1581
01:02:54,173 --> 01:02:57,673
what's the way to manage context well in code,

1582
01:02:58,173 --> 01:03:01,673
ultimately it's good abstraction and deduplication.

1583
01:03:02,173 --> 01:03:09,673
So from the start, clearly telling AI what engineering principles

1584
01:03:10,173 --> 01:03:15,673
you'll use to design this code, and continuously refactoring with AI,

1585
01:03:15,673 --> 01:03:22,673
I think you can solve context from a structural perspective.

1586
01:03:23,173 --> 01:03:25,673
I agree, that's how the McDonald's principle works.

1587
01:03:26,173 --> 01:03:29,673
The headquarters gives the menu, containing these engineering principles,

1588
01:03:30,173 --> 01:03:31,673
and after setting this up well,

1589
01:03:32,173 --> 01:03:34,673
I rarely had the problem you mentioned when I first started,

1590
01:03:35,173 --> 01:03:38,673
partly because models got better, but also after swapping cheap models wisely,

1591
01:03:39,173 --> 01:03:40,673
it doesn't happen.

1592
01:03:41,673 --> 01:03:46,673
I totally agree with that.

1593
01:03:47,173 --> 01:03:54,673
Ultimately, all actions are activities creating higher information value,

1594
01:03:55,173 --> 01:03:58,673
you want to create higher value information from what you have.

1595
01:03:59,173 --> 01:04:01,673
From a product perspective, making frontend,

1596
01:04:02,173 --> 01:04:09,673
so what level of abstraction is the optimal trade-off point,

1597
01:04:09,673 --> 01:04:14,673
intuitively grasping that seems important,

1598
01:04:15,173 --> 01:04:16,673
so I don't know coding well.

1599
01:04:17,173 --> 01:04:18,673
I only know Python.

1600
01:04:19,173 --> 01:04:21,673
I need to make Streamlit, dashboards, web things,

1601
01:04:22,173 --> 01:04:27,673
so what I mainly do is "you're a frontend, backend, full-stack developer",

1602
01:04:28,173 --> 01:04:32,673
"if you had to explain a specific project to another LLM model,

1603
01:04:33,673 --> 01:04:39,673
structure the elements composing this project,

1604
01:04:40,173 --> 01:04:44,673
and write me a prompt that can organize each as a markdown file",

1605
01:04:45,173 --> 01:04:48,673
then I do Docs, LLM Docs,

1606
01:04:49,173 --> 01:04:54,673
architecture, backend, API call, rules, frontend, logic,

1607
01:04:55,173 --> 01:04:56,673
it all comes out like that.

1608
01:04:56,673 --> 01:05:01,673
I don't know, but feeding that abstracted info to GPT and asking,

1609
01:05:02,173 --> 01:05:03,673
it solves problems,

1610
01:05:04,173 --> 01:05:07,673
just copying and pasting the error message below that chat,

1611
01:05:08,173 --> 01:05:10,673
doing it 100 times, 20 times, like you did.

1612
01:05:11,173 --> 01:05:16,673
But the key is even if I don't know the right abstraction logic,

1613
01:05:17,173 --> 01:05:19,673
it knows, so "write it with that logic."

1614
01:05:20,173 --> 01:05:22,673
"You're a frontend developer, and full-stack."

1615
01:05:23,173 --> 01:05:24,673
It writes amazingly well.

1616
01:05:24,673 --> 01:05:26,673
Anyway, development needs architecture,

1617
01:05:27,173 --> 01:05:30,673
and backend and API call logic seem to be needed.

1618
01:05:34,673 --> 01:05:36,673
But ultimately,

1619
01:05:38,673 --> 01:05:41,673
ultimately there are points where I get stuck too.

1620
01:05:42,173 --> 01:05:45,673
Building that, there comes a moment it can't speak too,

1621
01:05:46,173 --> 01:05:50,673
since there's the concept of comments and refactoring,

1622
01:05:51,673 --> 01:05:55,673
ultimately I resonate with having to look yourself,

1623
01:05:56,173 --> 01:05:58,673
anyway it can't exceed my capability by much.

1624
01:05:59,173 --> 01:06:03,673
So when I'm stuck at that extreme point,

1625
01:06:04,173 --> 01:06:08,673
the minimum knowledge of frontend, backend, API needed at that moment,

1626
01:06:09,173 --> 01:06:11,673
"do I need to study this?" and it tells me everything.

1627
01:06:12,173 --> 01:06:13,673
I study that and just rebuild from scratch.

1628
01:06:15,673 --> 01:06:17,673
First time took 10 days,

1629
01:06:17,673 --> 01:06:21,673
so what? Rebuilding from scratch takes a day or two anyway.

1630
01:06:22,673 --> 01:06:29,673
That's unlearning and the concept of context abstraction, information abstraction.

1631
01:06:35,673 --> 01:06:40,673
We've done Q&A, for more curious things,

1632
01:06:41,173 --> 01:06:43,673
we'll now have networking time,

1633
01:06:44,173 --> 01:06:46,673
feel free to talk directly with the speakers,

1634
01:06:46,673 --> 01:06:50,673
or chat with people around you.

1635
01:06:51,673 --> 01:06:54,673
So from now on, freely network,

1636
01:06:55,173 --> 01:06:56,673
not sure how much time we'll give,

1637
01:06:57,173 --> 01:07:00,673
we've prepared about 30 minutes for networking.

1638
01:07:01,173 --> 01:07:04,673
And I'm originally from a developer background.

1639
01:07:05,173 --> 01:07:07,173
So developers have this performance thing,

1640
01:07:07,673 --> 01:07:09,673
there's a session called lightning talks.

1641
01:07:10,173 --> 01:07:13,673
The key is you take the mic and say what you want to say,

1642
01:07:13,673 --> 01:07:17,673
but the key is everyone does their own thing.

1643
01:07:18,673 --> 01:07:24,673
So if you want to attract attention, come up and do a lightning talk,

1644
01:07:25,173 --> 01:07:27,673
the mic is here, feel free to come up,

1645
01:07:28,173 --> 01:07:31,673
but there's a strict 3-minute time limit.

1646
01:07:32,173 --> 01:07:34,173
That's the charm of lightning talks.

1647
01:07:34,673 --> 01:07:38,673
So from now on, our speakers and attendees,

1648
01:07:39,173 --> 01:07:41,673
please network freely.
